The judgment addresses a procedural error by the Registry of the court.  A counter-affidavit was accepted from a proposed respondent (Mr. Amandeep Singh) who had not yet been officially impleaded into the case (SLP No. 161791/2024).  The Registry's explanation, citing established practice, was deemed insufficient. The court criticized the Registry for repeatedly accepting documents from non-parties and for failing to comply with Supreme Court Rules.  The Registrar (Judicial) is directed to report on actions taken to address these ongoing procedural issues. The interim order remains in effect until the next hearing on February 21, 2025.
