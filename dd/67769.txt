The judgment concerns an appeal against a Delhi High Court order that overturned a lower court's discharge of the appellant in a rape and criminal intimidation case (FIR No. 281/2021).  The complainant alleged a sexual relationship with the appellant based on a promise of marriage, which was later broken. The lower court discharged the appellant, finding the relationship consensual. The High Court reversed this, finding sufficient material for charges.  The Supreme Court, however, agrees with the lower court's discharge, citing the consensual nature of the relationship and the lack of evidence of dishonest inducement or coercion.  The Supreme Court emphasizes that a mere breach of a promise to marry does not automatically constitute rape, and that the prolonged nature of the relationship suggests informed consent.  The appeal is allowed, the High Court order is set aside, and the criminal proceedings are terminated.  The Supreme Court's decision relies heavily on the precedent set in *Naim Ahmed vs. State (NCT) of Delhi*, which addresses similar circumstances.
