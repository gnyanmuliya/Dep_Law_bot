The Enquiry Officer furthermore, did not properly appreciate the evidence adduced by P.W.3. It appears from the evidence on record that P.W. 3 instructed the appellant to withhold a sum of Rs. 2000/- from the first running bill of the Contractor due to slow progress of work. Therefore, it cannot be said that the appellant herein was responsible for non-payment of the bills of the Contractor in time. The conduct of the Contractor should also be taken into consideration specially when we find that the Superior Authority like P.W. 3 was compelled to issue instruction for withholding of the running bill of the said Contractor. In any event, the Enquiry Officer cannot overreach the judicial findings in respect of P.W.2. The Enquiry Officer relied on the evidence of P.W.2 (D. N.

It was submitted that the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar (verbatim) set of facts and evidence. The appellant has been honourably acquitted by the competent court on the same set of facts, evidence and witness and, therefore, the dismissal order based on the same set of facts and evidence on the departmental side is liable to be set aside in the interest of justice. &quot;Such is not a situation in the present case. In our opinion the present is not a case of no evidence; it is a case of not sufficient evidence. There is a clear distinction between the two situations. Therefore, in our opinion, the observations in <B>G.M. Tank's case</B> (supra) would not be applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. In this case, before concluding that it is necessary to hold a departmental enquiry, the Disciplinary Authority has also considered the observations made by the Appeal Court to the effect that due to non-mentioning of arrangement to keep the flush door open in the pre-trap memo, it could hardly be accepted that such arrangement was made for keeping the door partly open. The Disciplinary Authority was certainly aware of the entire reasoning of the Appellate Court. The Disciplinary Authority was aware of the conclusion of the Appellate Court that &quot;hardly, I find any material to place reliance on such evidence so as to hold that really some sort of shady transaction as has been alleged from the side of prosecution was going on between the petitioner and P.W.-1.&quot; The Disciplinary Authority also notices that, in conclusion it is observed by the Court of Appeal that the present case casts &quot;serious doubt&quot; on the allegation. On a very close scrutiny of the entire matter the Disciplinary Authority has concluded that it would not amount to an honourable acquittal. We are inclined to accept the reasons of the Disciplinary Authority, as we are also of the opinion that this acquittal can hardly be equated with the declaration of innocence of the respondent.

This bar is not applicable in departmental proceedings. Therefore, the Enquiry Officer would be entitled to take into consideration the evidentiary value of the confession made by the respondent.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">The other instance that seems to have weighed with the Appellate Court is that there is no mention in the pre-raid memo with regard to the arrangement having been made for the door being kept open. Again the evidence on this may not have been sufficient to say that the fact has been proved beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal trial, but the Enquiry Officer would have to look at the evidence on the basis of preponderance of probabilities. P.W.-12, the leader of the CBI Trap-party, has categorically stated &quot;that he made an arrangement to keep the door of the chamber of Accused No.1 partly opened so that one can see inside the chamber from the outside.&quot; The statement of P.W.1 is corroborated by the statements of P.W.2 and P.W.3 who stated in their evidence that they witnessed the transaction of bribe from outside the chamber as the door of the chamber was partly opened.

Where there are some relevant materials which the authority has accepted and which materials may reasonably support the conclusion that the officer is guilty, it is not the function of the High Court exercising its jurisdiction under Article 226 to review the materials and to arrive at an independent finding on the materials.
