If the Tribunal had reason to doubt the medical certificate, the option available before it was to have the disability re-assessed but it could not have gone into the details of the determination of disability. Since that course of action has not been adopted, the opinion of the Medical Board, being an opinion of the experts is to be treated as such.

He cannot stand or walk and has a catheter. Further, he is dependent entirely on others for daily activities. The finding of 100% disability, therefore, appears to be justified. As such, the compensation ought to be recomputed. It is also to be noted that for a person in coma, who is entirely dependent on others, obviously a meagre sum of Rs.2,00,000/- stands awarded by the Tribunal towards mental and physical agony, pain, and loss of amenities. The High Court has also confirmed the same. We find the same to be insufficient. Keeping in view the discussion made by this Court in the recent decision, <B>K.S Murlidhar vs. R. Subbulakshmi, 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3385</B>, and having due regard to the age, nature of disability and other relevant factors, the compensation under this head is split from the general head. The amount of Rs.2,00,000/- now stands awarded under 'Physical and Mental Agony'. However, in the attending facts and circumstances of this case, we enhance the compensation by Rs.6,00,000/-as payable under the head 'Pain and Suffering'.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 12.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The final compensation payable to the claimant-appellant is tabulated as below-</P> <P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=7 WIDTH=800> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Head</B></TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Tribunal</B></TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">High Court</B></TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Final Compensation</B></TD> </TR> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Monthly Income</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,895/- p.m.</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,895/- p.m.</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,895/-p.m</TD> </TR> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Annual Income</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,895 x 12 = Rs.1,90,740/-</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,895 x 12 = Rs.1,90,740/-</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,895 x12 = Rs.1,90,740/-</TD> </TR> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Loss of Future Income</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.12,39,810/- [1,90,740 x 50 x 13/100]</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">&nbsp;</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">[Disability @50% Multiplier x13]</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.12,39,810/- [1,90,740 x 50 x 13/100]</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">&nbsp;</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">[Disability @ 50%]</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.24,79,620/- [1,90,740x13X 100%] 190740 x 25/100 </P> <p style="Text-align : justify">&nbsp;</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">[Disability @ 100%]</TD> </TR> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Loss in Future Prospect</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <P ALIGN="CENTER">_</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.15,49,763/- [12,39,810 x 25/100]</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">&nbsp;</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">[Future Prospect @ 25%]</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <B><p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.30,99,525/-</B> [24,79,620 x 25/100] </P> <p style="Text-align : justify">&nbsp;</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">[Future Prospect @ 25%]</TD> </TR> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Attendant Charges</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <P ALIGN="CENTER">_</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <P ALIGN="CENTER">_</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.5,000/- x 12 x 13 = <B>Rs.7,80,000/-</B></TD> </TR> <TR><TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Medical Reimbursement</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.1,71,155/-</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.1,71,155/-</TD> <TD WIDTH="" VALIGN="TOP"> <B><p style="Text-align : justify">Rs.1,71,155/-</B></TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER></P>    </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 13.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The amount payable to the claimant-appellant is Rs.48,69,180/-, and the same is rounded off to Rs.48,70,000/- with an interest @ 7% per annum due from the date of the claim petition.
