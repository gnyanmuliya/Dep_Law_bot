(C) No. 36 of 2011 and W.P. (C). No. 26 of 2011 by way of common judgement and order dated 29.11.2012. The pertinent findings in the judgement dated 29.11.2012 have been culled out hereinunder:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">a. The High Court took note of the fact that lottery, per se, falls within the expression "betting and gambling", which is considered pernicious in nature. It receives legal validity only if it is run or authorised by the State Government, subject to the conditions laid down in Section 4 of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 which is a Central enactment. The Court further observed that it is the State's privilege that can be partially delegated to another party, provided they adhere to the statutory conditions contained in the regulatory Act.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">b. Although no Entry in any of the Lists of the Seventh Schedule specifically provides for levying taxes on lotteries, the power to enact laws for taxing lotteries must be understood as inherent within the expressions "betting and gambling," as lottery activities fall within this category.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">c. The High Court noted that betting and gambling itself is an activity though the lottery ticket is a tangible thing that carries with it the right to participate in the game of chance. Thus, all activities right from the publishing of the lottery tickets to participation in the game of chance, declaration of draw and even distribution of prize to the winner fall within the purview of the expression 'betting and gambling'. Thus the power to levy tax on the organisation, promotion and marketing of lottery being an act of betting and gambling comes within the exclusive domain of Entry 62 - List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">d. The High Court applied the test of the principle of pith and substance and observed that the power to levy tax on lotteries, which are considered games of chance and fall under "betting and gambling" in Entry 62 - List II, lies exclusively with the State Legislature. Consequently, Parliament's authority to impose such a tax under its residuary power in Entry 97 - List I, read with Article 248 of the Constitution, is excluded. The High Court held that while Parliament is competent to levy service tax under Entry 97 - List I, this does not imply that it can impose such a tax on lotteries, as the power to levy taxes on this subject has been conferred on the State Legislature in List II. That the residuary powers of Parliament can only be exercised when no Entry in any of the Lists provide a legislative field. Hence, it is the exclusive legislative domain of the State Legislature to levy tax of any nature on lotteries by virtue of Entry 62 - List II.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">e. The High Court further held that when a distributor purchases goods at a commercial price, they are not acting as an agent for the manufacturer.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">f. The High Court observed that in the case at hand, the lottery tickets are sold as goods by the State Government to the assesses therein at a discounted price of 70 paise per ticket, compared to the MRP of Re.1. The predominant part of the transaction is a sale of goods. While considering the 30% discount offered to the respondents-assessees herein on the MRP, the High Court took note that offering such discounts is a normal trade practice in any sale and purchase transaction. If the seller sells the goods at the MRP to the ultimate consumer, intermediaries must receive a discount to cover establishment costs, logistics, and some margin of profit. </P> <p style="Text-align : justify">g. Upon perusal of various clauses in the agreement, the High Court observed that the State Government appoints stockists or distributors to sell the tickets to ultimate buyers, who purchase them at the MRP. These intermediaries must be provided discounts from the MRP to cover their expenses and ensure a profit margin.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">h. The High Court also held that the advertisement expenses incurred for promoting the State lottery are borne by the respondents-assessees herein to promote their own business, not as a service to the State Government. Clause (20) of the agreement further stipulates that the petitioner therein is solely responsible for incurring all advertising expenses, including the publication of lottery results.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">i. In light of the above observations, the High Court held that in the case at hand the lottery is organised by the state government through its various stockists etc. but cannot be construed to be a service rendered to the State Government. Hence, the question of service tax does not arise.</P></DIR>

Being aggrieved by the specific findings in judgment dated 23.03.2017 wherein the High Court held that there was no mechanism or methodology to ascertain and compute the services rendered by the respondent-assessees, the respondent-assessee has filed SLP (C) No.19200 of 2017.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Submissions before this Court:</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 7. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">Learned Counsel for the Revenue, Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi made the following submissions:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">a. The statutory framework governing lotteries, particularly the Lotteries (Regulation) Act of 1998 (&quot;Lotteries Act&quot;, for short) and related rules, mandate that the organizing State must be the ultimate seller of lottery tickets to the public, inherently establishing an agency relationship between the State of Sikkim and the respondents-assessees herein in these cases. Article 246(1) of the Indian Constitution empowers Parliament to legislate on lotteries conducted by the government, which it exercised by enacting the Lotteries Act. Section 4(c) of this Act prescribes that the State government must sell tickets &quot;either itself or through distributors or selling agents.&quot; Further, Rule 2(1)(c) of the Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2010 (&quot;Lotteries Rules&quot;, for short) defines a &quot;distributor or selling agent&quot; as an entity appointed by the organizing State to sell tickets on behalf of the State. Learned counsel argued that the use of terms such as &quot;through&quot; and &quot;on behalf of&quot; in the statute is conclusive evidence of the intended agency relationship, as these terms denote that the respondents-assessees herein are merely facilitating sales on behalf of the State, not as independent principals.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">b. The judgment in <B>State of Haryana vs. Suman Enterprises, (1994) 4 SCC 217</B> held that a State-organized lottery requires the State to retain core control to protect public trust in the scheme. In that case, this Court stated four essential characteristics that distinguish a State-organized lottery: (i) tickets must bear the State's logo, be printed under the State's authority, and be sold directly by the State or its designated agents; (ii) the sale proceeds must be credited to the State's funds; (iii) draws must be conducted by the State; and (iv) unclaimed prize money must revert to the State. By retaining control over these aspects, the State ensures that the public's trust in the lottery's fairness and legitimacy is maintained. That these characteristics form the backbone of the Lotteries Act, and when combined with statutory language, they mandate an agency relationship between the respondents-assessees herein and the State, which cannot be unilaterally recharacterized as principal to principal.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">c. The State of Sikkim's monopoly over the lottery business in the region, as enacted under the Sikkim Lotteries (Prohibition on Running of and Sale of Single Digit and Private Lottery Tickets) Act, 1993, further supports the agency interpretation. Learned counsel cited <B>Khoday Distilleries Ltd vs. State of Karnataka, (1995) 1 SCC 574</B> and argued that the State can either conduct the monopoly business itself or do so through agents but cannot delegate its core functions to independent entities without compromising the monopoly. The counsel argued that in lotteries, as in the sale of alcohol monopolized by the State, the organizing State cannot delegate its position as the primary seller and principal.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">d. As per clauses in the agreements between the State of Sikkim and the respondents-assessees herein, specifically focusing on clauses that indicate a principal-agent relationship, two critical &quot;condition precedents&quot; that help determine whether an agency exists are, namely, (i) the capacity in which the sale is conducted, i.e., whether the respondents-assessees herein are selling the tickets as their own or on behalf of the State; and (ii) the allocation of risk and reward, which lies with the principal in an agency relationship.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">e. Various versions of agreements between the State and the respondents-assessees herein, notably those signed in 2004, 2008 and 2009 were referred to. Initially, under the 2004 agreement, the respondents-assessees herein purchased lottery tickets on an &quot;all sold&quot; basis, meaning they bought all tickets upfront and assumed the associated risk. However, subsequent amendments, particularly in 2008 and 2009, shifted this arrangement to an &quot;actual sold&quot; basis, where the respondents-assessees herein took delivery of the tickets without upfront payment, returning unsold tickets to the State. Additionally, the State's revenue became tied to the actual sales made by the respondents-assessees herein rather than a fixed sum, indicating that the State retained the risk and reward from ticket sales, characteristic of a principalagent relationship.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">f. For online lotteries, the agreements did not involve any physical transfer of tickets to the respondents-assessees herein. Instead, tickets were directly sold by the State to customers through computer terminals managed by the respondents-assessees herein. Learned counsel argued that this arrangement further underscored the agency relationship, as the respondents-assessees herein merely facilitated sales made by the State, with the State bearing the risk associated with prize payouts. It was emphasised that the respondents-assessees herein received a commission calculated as a percentage of total sales after deducting the State's revenue and prize distributions, which aligns with compensation typically earned by agents.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">g. Further, the respondents-assessees' argument before the High Court was that they occasionally incurred losses due to unsold tickets or fluctuating demand, thereby bearing risk and acting as principals. Learned counsel for the Revenue sought to rebut this contention by submitting that under the amended agreements, unsold tickets were returned to the State, with no financial obligation on the part of the respondents-assessees herein. In online lotteries, while the respondents-assessees herein may have to temporarily cover prize payouts under INR 10,000/- the risk ultimately remained with the State, which controlled the final prize distribution. That occasional operational costs borne by the respondents-assessees herein, such as those related to maintaining terminals or sub-agent commissions, were incidental to their role as agents and did not alter the fundamental agency relationship.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">h. Learned counsel for the Revenue thus concluded that both statutory requirements and the practical structure of the agreements compel the interpretation of the respondents-assessees' role as agents of the State of Sikkim. He asserted that these agreements, along with judicial precedents and statutory provisions, leave no room for a principal-principal relationship. By mandating that the State remains the ultimate seller and by ensuring that risk and reward lie with the State, the Lotteries Act and the related legal framework firmly establish respondents-assessees' position as agents acting on behalf of the State. Accordingly, it was urged that service tax, calculated on the basis of services provided, should apply to the respondents-assessees herein as agents in line with the legislative intent and legal precedent.</P></DIR>
   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 8. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">Per contra, Sri S Ganesh, learned senior counsel and Sri A.R. Madhav Rao, learned counsel appearing for the respondents-assessees broadly advanced the following submissions:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">a. The respondents-assessees herein in these cases operated independently on a principal-to-principal basis and the agreement between the State and the respondents-assessees herein is structured in a way that reflects a buyer-seller relationship and not an agency.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">b. The respondents-assessees herein are mandated to pay a guaranteed minimum amount of Rs.8 crores to the State Government irrespective of the number of tickets sold. Additionally, the respondents-assessees herein have to furnish a bank guarantee to secure payment. The State does not indemnify the respondents-assessees herein, in case of any loss. Therefore, indemnification being a hallmark of agency but in the instant cases, the respondents-assessees herein are bearing all the financial risk and the State Government does not indemnify the respondents-assessees herein, then the relationship between the parties has to be principal to principal.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">c. Once the respondents-assessees herein purchase tickets from the State, it sells them onward at its discretion to subcontractors or stockists. The sale proceeds exclusively belong to the respondents-assessees herein. The State government has no privity of contract with the sub-distributors. Therefore, it was argued that the respondents-assessees herein are not operating on behalf of the State Government.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">d. That the respondents-assessees herein bear the entire cost of marketing and advertising without reimbursement from the State Government. Further, the respondents-assessees herein appoint stockists and sellers independently at its own risk. Hence, there is no notion of agency involved.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">e. Thus, service tax under the Finance Act, 1994 does not arise in the present case since no service is being provided by the respondents-assessees herein. It was argued that the respondents-assessees herein are involved in a purchase and resale arrangement.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">f. In K. Arumugam, this Court held that buying lottery tickets and reselling them does not amount to marketing services.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">g. Section 67 of the Finance Act requires service tax to be made applicable only when there is consideration for a specific service. In the present case, the margins earned by the respondents-assessees herein do not represent any commission or service. There is no service or consideration in the present case as the transaction is an outright sale at a price lower than the maximum price of each lottery ticket.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">h. Lottery tickets constitute actionable claims and thus transactions involving actionable claims are exempted under Section 66D of the Finance Act, 1994. The argument of the Revenue that the lottery ticket is actionable only in the hands of the ultimate buyer is false and baseless. In response, it was submitted that the nature of tickets remains unchanged regardless of ownership, as established in <B>Sunrise Associates vs. Government of NCT of Delhi, (2006) 5 SCC 603</B>, (&quot;Sunrise Associates&quot;).</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">i. That levy of service tax on lottery distributors infringes the State government's exclusive power to legislate on &quot;betting and gambling&quot; under Entry 62 - List II of the Constitution, Buttressing his submissions, learned senior counsel relied on <B>Godfrey Philips India Limited vs. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2005) 2 SCC 515</B> emphasizing that Parliament cannot use a residuary entry under Entry 97 - List I to impose taxes on subjects reserved for the States.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">j. That aspects theory cannot be applied to the present case to justify service tax. The sale of lottery tickets is a single transaction and cannot be split artificially into a sale and a service.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">k. Taxing such transactions as services would create uncertainty for other industries. If every resale of goods could be labelled as a service, it would disrupt the established business practices across sectors.</P></DIR>
   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 9. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">Learned counsel for Union of India addressed and rebutted several contentions made by the respondents-assessees herein to support their claim of operating as principals. One of the key arguments by the respondents-assessees herein was that they were in the &quot;business&quot; of buying and selling lottery tickets, and therefore should be considered independent principals. Learned counsel countered this by referring to Sunrise Associates, which held that the purchase of a lottery ticket confers a conditional interest in the prize money (an actionable claim) to the buyer. Since the respondents-assessees herein do not possess any actionable claim (as they cannot participate in the lottery), they cannot be classified as true &quot;buyers&quot; of lottery tickets. Thus, they are limited to selling tickets only as agents of the State.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Points for Consideration:</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 10.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The following points would arise for our consideration:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">a) Whether the impugned judgments of the High Court of Sikkim would call for any interference in these appeals?</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">b) If not, what order?</P></DIR>
  <p style="Text-align : justify"> At this stage, we state that we need not go into the question regarding the aspect theory/doctrine being made applicable to these cases. This is because we are dealing with the question whether service tax is liable to be paid by the respondent-assessees. According to the appellant- Union of India they are liable to pay service tax as they are rendering a service to State of Sikkim as an agent. On the other hand, it is the case of the respondent-assessees that they are not agents of the Government of Sikkim but their relationship is on principal to principal basis. If we hold that the relationship between the State of Sikkim is of principalagent then the respondents-assessees herein are liable to pay service tax as an agent. However, this does not detract from the respondent-assessees being liable to pay tax on gambling as the conduct of lotteries is nothing but a gambling activity as per Entry 62 - List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Therefore, it is necessary for us to consider whether the respondents-assessees are engaged as agents by the principalGovernment of Sikkim or the relationship is one of principal to principal.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Relevant constitutional provisions:</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 11.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In order to better understand the controversy in these cases, it would be relevant to advert to the provisions of the Constitution as well as the provisions of the Finance Act, 1994 along with the amendments made which have sought to impose service tax on the respondents-assessees herein in these cases.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 11.1</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Article 246 of the Constitution of India pertains to the division of subjects between the Parliament and State Legislatures in the form of three lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, namely List I - Union List, List II - State List and List III - Concurrent List.

At any rate, whatever doubt there may be on the interpretation of Entry 97, List I is removed by the wide terms of Article 248. It is framed in the widest possible terms. On its terms the only question to be asked is: Is the matter sought to be legislated or included in List II or in List III or is the tax sought to be levied mentioned in List II or in List III: No question has to be asked about List I. If the answer is in the negative then it follows that Parliament has power to make laws with respect to that matter or tax.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> According to this Court, if a Central Act is challenged as being beyond the legislative competence of Parliament, it is enough to enquire if it is a law with respect to matters or taxes enumerated in List II. If it is not, no further question arises.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Thus, the wide words of a substantive Article like Article 248 should be given full effect and they cannot be cut down by the wording in the Lists in Schedule VII merely because certain known taxes have not been included therein.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Relevant Case Law on lotteries:</P> <I> <p style="Text-align : justify"> B.R.

Even though lotteries were permitted under the regulating power of the State, they could not be given the status of trade and commerce &quot;as understood in common parlance&quot;. Trade and commerce within the meaning of Articles 301 to 304. That there are three ingredients in the sale of lottery tickets, namely (i) price, (ii) chance, and (iii) consideration. That Entry 62 - List II refers to taxes on betting and gambling and lotteries whether conducted by private agencies or by the State are nothing but gambling. That even though the state may conduct lotteries, the element of chance remains, with no skill involved, while in a trade there is skill involved with no chance. Even if the State conduct lotteries, the element of chance remains, with no skill involved and even the organisation and conduct of the lotteries by the State Government are within the boundaries of gambling. That the only purpose of having stringent measures visa-vis lotteries being conducted by the State was to inculcate faith in the participants of such lottery being conducted fairly with no possibility of fraud or misappropriation and deceit and assure the hopeful recipients of high prizes that all is fair and safe. That the object was to assure the participants that the proceeds from the sale of lottery tickets are credited to the public accounts of the State and would not be in the hands of any individual group or association and thus to bring about a transparency in the organisation of the lottery by the State, subject to the regulation. Even then, the activity of conduct of the lottery would remain in the realm of gambling.</P> <b> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Sunrise Associates:</P> </B></I>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 12.1</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In the case of Sunrise Associates, the Constitution Bench of this Court speaking through Ruma Pal, J., opined that lottery tickets can be categorized as actionable claims. The relevant paragraphs of the said judgment read as under:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;40. An actionable claim would include a right to recover insurance money or a partner's right to sue for an account of a dissolved partnership or the right to claim the benefit of a contract not coupled with any liability (see <B>Union of India v. Sri Sarada Mills Ltd. [(1972) 2 SCC 877]</B> , SCC at p. 880). A claim for arrears of rent has also been held to be an actionable claim (<B>State of Bihar v. Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh [(1952) 1 SCC 528 : 1952 SCR 889 : AIR 1952 SC 252]</B> , SCR at p. 910). A right to the credit in a provident fund account has also been held to be an actionable claim (<B>Official Trustee v. L. Chippendale [AIR 1944 Cal 335 : ILR (1943) 2 Cal 325]</B> ; <B>Bhupati Mohan Das v. Phanindra Chandra Chakravarty [AIR 1935 Cal 756 : 40 CWN 102]</B> ). In our opinion a sale of a lottery ticket also amounts to the transfer of an actionable claim.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">44. The question is, what is this right which the ticket represents? There can be no doubt that on purchasing a lottery ticket, the purchaser would have a claim to a conditional interest in the prize money which is not in the purchaser's possession. The right would fall squarely within the definition of an actionable claim and would therefore be excluded from the definition of &quot;goods&quot; under the Sale of Goods Act and the sales tax statutes. This was also accepted in <B>H. Anraj [(1986) 1 SCC 414 : 1986 SCC (Tax) 190]</B> when the Court said that to the extent that the sale of a lottery ticket involved a transfer of the right to claim a prize depending on chance, it was an assignment of an actionable claim.

The same was resisted by the assessees by filing writ petitions before the High Courts.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Both the High Courts of Sikkim as well as that of Kerala held against the assessees and opined that service tax is leviable on their activity under the nomenclature of business auxiliary service.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Hence appeals were filed before this Court. The following questions arose for consideration:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;1. Whether the activity of the appellants - assessees would attract service tax within the scope and ambit of Section 65(19)(ii) read with Section 65(105)(zzb) of the Finance Act, 1994? If not, what relief(s) the appellants are entitled to?</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">2. What Order?&quot;</P></DIR>
  <p style="Text-align : justify"> In K. Arumugam, on a plain reading of the Explanation in light of the activity actually carried on by the appellant(s)-assessee(s) therein, it was clear that the outright purchase of lottery tickets from the promoters of the State or Directorate of Lotteries, as the case may be, was not a service in relation to promotion or marketing of service provided by the client, i.e., the State, conducting the lottery. The conduct of lottery is a revenue generating activity by a State or any other entity in the field of actionable claims. The client, i.e., the State was not engaging in an activity of service while dealing with the business of lottery. Explanation to sub-clause (ii) of clause (19) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994 could not bring within sub-clause (ii) activity by assuming it was initially covered under sub-clause (i) thereof but in fact was not, by virtue of the definition of goods under the very same Act read with Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. It was observed that the mere insertion of an explanation could not make an activity a taxable service when it was not covered under the main provision (which had to be read into the said sub-clause by virtue of the legislative device of express incorporation). This is because sale of lottery tickets is not a service in relation to promotion or marketing of service provided by a client, i.e., the State in the instant case. Conducting a lottery which is a game of chance is ex facie a privilege and an activity conducted by the State and not a service being rendered by the State. The said activity would have a profit motive and is for the purpose of earning additional revenue to the State exchequer. The activity is carried out by sale of lottery tickets to persons, such as the assessees herein, on an outright basis and once the lottery tickets are sold and the amount collected, there is no further relationship between the assessees herein and the State in respect of the lottery tickets sold. The burden is on the assessees herein to further sell the lottery tickets to the divisional/regional stockists for a profit as their business activity. It was observed that the activity is not a promotion or a marketing service rendered by the assessees to the State within the meaning of sub-clause (ii) of clause (19) of Section 65 of the Finance Act, 1994. This is because, to reiterate, the States are not rendering a service but engaged in the activity of conducting lottery to earn additional revenue. Moreover, once the lottery tickets are sold by the Directorate of Lotteries - a Department of the State, there is transfer of the title in the lottery tickets to the vendees, who, as owners of the said lottery tickets, in turn sell them to stockists and others. Thus, there is no promotion of the business of the State as its agent. Thus, there is no 'principal-agent' relationship which would normally be the case in a relationship where a business auxiliary service is rendered. The relationship between the State and the appellants is on a principal to principal basis. Thus, there is no activity of promotion or marketing of a service on behalf of the State. Neither is the State, which conducts the lottery, rendering a service within the meaning of the Finance Act, 1994.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Legal Framework:</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 13.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> For ease of reference, the provisions relating to imposition of service tax on the sale of lotteries in five different periods namely, from 01.07.2003 to 30.06.2010, from 01.07.2010 to 30.06.2012, from 01.07.2012 to 31.05.2015, from 01.06.2015 to 31.03.2016 and from 01.04.2016 to 30.06.2017 are encapsulated under the respective headings:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <B><p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;I.

   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.2</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> According to Bowstead and Reynolds on Agency, 23rd Edition, agency is the fiduciary relationship which exists between two persons, one of whom expressly or impliedly manifests assent that the other should act on his behalf so as to affect his legal relations with third parties and the other of whom similarly manifests assent so as to act or so acts pursuant to the manifestation. Thus, the one on whose behalf the act or acts have to be done is called the principal and the other who is to act is called the agent. Any person other than the principal and the agent may be referred to as the third party. The authority of the agent to act on behalf of the principal constitutes a power to affect the principal's legal relations with third parties. Such authority could be called actual authority or apparent authority. Thus, the essence of agency is that a person acts on the principal's behalf. Therefore, the term agency is used to connote an authority or capacity in one person to create legal relations between a person occupying the position of principal and third parties. Usually, the legal relations so created will be contractual in nature. Conversely, the mere fact that a person does something in order to benefit another and the latter is relying on the former to do so or may have requested or even contracted for performance of the action, does not make the former the agent of the latter. The centrality to agency is the conferral of authority to alter legal relations; as such in common law, being an agent is not a status but a description of a person, while and only so long as the person is exercising such authority. Thus, where one person (the principal), requests or authorises the other (agent), to act on his behalf and the other agrees to do so, the law recognises that such agent has power to affect the principal's legal position by acts which, though performed by the agent, are to be treated in certain respects as if they were acts of the principal. It is common to regard control by the principal as a defining characteristic of agency. Thus, agency is termed as acting on behalf of the principal and subject to principal's control.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.3</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> An agency has to be distinguished from other relationships such as an agent and trustee; agent and bailee; agent and employee; agent and independent contractor; agent and seller; agent and buyer; agent and borrower; agent and person supplying services.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.4</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Suppliers of the goods of a manufacturer, whether on a retail or wholesale basis, who have some form of concession as a regular stockist, distributor or franchisee, are often described as agent, selling agent, main agent, etc. for the manufacturer of goods which they supply. However, nowadays the distributor actually buys from the manufacturer and resells it to his own customers. In such cases, the term 'agent' is used in a complimentary sense only, i.e., not to transact any business on behalf of the principal, except as regards purchase of the goods from the principal. Such a relationship is quite different from an agency. The distinction between an agent and the buyer for resale normally turns on whether the person concerned acts personally to make such profit as can be made, or is remunerated by pre-arranged commission. A supplier who fixes the resale price is likely to be a buyer for resale. If a party takes a profit on the resale, it will make him a seller. On the other hand, if a commission is paid on the resale, then, he is likely to be an agent.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.5</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In Benjamin's Sale of Goods, Eleventh Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, it has been stated that sale has to be distinguished from a contract of agency. When goods are delivered to another for sale to a third party, the recipient may be an outright buyer, or may take the goods on sale or return, or may merely be the supplier's agent to sell the goods, or an agent on a del credere commission, i.e., an agent who guarantees to the principal that the buyer will duly pay the price.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.6</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> To determine the nature of the transaction, the whole agreement must be looked into as &quot;the test is ultimately one of substance rather than form&quot;.

Also, certain stipulations may be consistent with both sale (and especially sale or return) and agency, and, therefore, cannot be taken as indicative of either; for instance, the transfer to the consignee of the property in goods shipped upon the acceptance of drafts. It is, however, evidence towards a sale that the recipient is entitled to sell at whatever price the recipient thinks fit, accounting to the supplier only for a predetermined sum, and this interpretation is given further support, if the recipient is free to alter or improve the goods. Where the consignee pays wholesale prices for the goods, he is likely to be acting as a principal in the sale. If the consignee sells (whether for cash or on credit) to a retail purchaser, this immediately gives rise to a debt to the supplier for the listed price, the transaction becomes quite inconsistent with agency, including del credere agency, and would be consistent only with sale or return.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Case Law:</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Learned counsel for the respective parties relied upon the following cases in support of their submissions:</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.1</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In <B>Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. vs. STO, (1977) 3 SCC 147</B>, (&quot;Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd.&quot;) the question was whether the contract was one of agency or sale. This Court held that the question will have to be determined having regard to the terms and recitals of the agreement, the intention of the parties as may be spelt out from the terms of the document and the surrounding circumstances and having regard to the course of dealings between the parties. While interpreting the terms of the agreement, the Court has to look to the substance rather than the form of it. The mere fact that the word &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;agency&quot; is used or the words &quot;buyer&quot; and &quot;seller&quot; are used to describe the status of the parties concerned is not sufficient to lead to the irresistible inference that the parties did in fact intend that the said status would be conferred. In this case, the point for consideration was whether at the time when the appellant was consuming high speed diesel oil and petrol for its own purposes, was it doing so as the owner of these articles or merely as an agent under an agreement with Caltex Company. If the relationship was of an agent, then the usage of those articles or properties by the appellant therein would amount to a sale so as to be exigible to sales tax. On the other hand, if the diesel or petrol was used by the appellant therein as an owner of those articles, then sales tax would have been paid by the appellant therein when property had passed on to it and were received by the appellant therein.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.1.1.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In this context, this Court observed that a contract of agency differs essentially from a contract of sale inasmuch as an agent, after taking delivery of the property, does not sell it as his own property but sells the same as the property of the principal and under his instructions and directions. Furthermore, since the agent is not the owner of the goods, if any loss is suffered by the agent then he is to be indemnified by the principal. It was further observed that while interpreting the terms of the agreement, the Court has to look to the substance rather than the form of it. Thus, the mere formal description of a person as an &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;buyer&quot; is not conclusive, unless the context shows that the parties clearly intended to treat a buyer as a buyer and not as an agent.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.1.2.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> It was further observed on an examination of the terms of the contract therein that Hispeedol (petroleum product) had been sold to the appellant therein and not held by it merely as an agent of the Caltex Company. Therefore, the agreement therein contained some elements of agency but having regard to the fact that the appellant therein was consuming the Hispeedol or petrol for its own purpose, it was acting as an owner of the goods and if it consumed the same for its own purposes, it was not doing so as agent but as owner which it was fully entitled to do. Therefore, it would not constitute a sale so as to be exigible to sales tax.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.2</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Reference could also be made to <B>Sri Tirumala Venkateswara Timber and Bamboo Firm vs. Commercial Tax Officer, Rajahmundry, AIR 1968 SC 784</B>, wherein this Court observed that there is a distinction between a contract of sale and a contract of agency by which the agent is authorised to sell or buy on behalf of the principal. The essence of a contract of sale is the transfer of title to the goods for a price paid or promised to be paid. The transferee in such a case is liable to the transferor as a debtor for the price to be paid and not as an agent for the proceeds of the sale. The essence of agency to sell is the delivery of the goods to a person who is to sell them, not as his own property but as the property of the principal who continues to be the owner of the goods, and will therefore be liable to account for the sale proceeds. That in certain trades the word &quot;agent&quot; is often used without any reference to the law of principal and agent. But the true relationship of the parties in such a case has to be gathered from the nature of the contract, its terms and conditions, and the terminology used by the parties is not decisive of the said relationship.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.3</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In <B>Moped India Ltd. vs. Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Nellore, (1986) 1 SCC 125</B>, one of the questions was whether the commission allowed in respect of different varieties of mopeds to the dealers could be regarded as a trade discount or not. The contention was that the commission allowed to the dealers was a trade discount and was, therefore, liable to be deducted in determining the excisable value of the mopeds. In the agreement, the amount was referred to as &quot;commission&quot; but the label given by the parties could not be determinative because it was for the Court to decide whether the amount was a &quot;trade discount&quot; or not, whatever be the name given to it. Having regard to the terms of the agreement, this Court held that it was on a principal to principal basis. That under the agreement, mopeds were sold by the appellants therein to the dealers and the dealers did not act as agents of the appellants for the purpose of effecting sales on behalf of the appellants therein. Having regard to various clauses of the agreement considered in the said case, it was held that the relationship between the appellants and the dealers therein was on a principal to principal basis and therefore, the amount allowed to the dealers in respect of different varieties of mopeds was a trade discount. The appellants therein charged to the dealers the price of the mopeds sold to them less the amount of Rs.110, Rs.145 and Rs.165 as commission in respect of different varieties of mopeds.

(Company) to effect the sale of certain chemical manufactured by the said company in the area covered by the Kerala State under an agreement entered into on 11.02.1967. This Court examined whether under the agreement, the assessee firm was an agent of the said company, or whether under the agreement the assessee firm was really a purchaser of the goods which were booked by it. In the Agreement, the stipulation was that the distributor had the right of the sale of the product within the stipulated area. Bulk supplies were effected in wagon load or lorry-load by the said company direct to the customer, but only provided that the distributor arranged the payment as per the agreement and also took the responsibility to bear entirely the resultant effects and risk from the said direct dispatches. Though the company had fixed the price at which the goods were to be sold to the customers, it did not lead to the conclusion that the distributor was merely an agent. Under the agreement, what the distributor received was described as a &quot;rebate&quot; and not a &quot;commission&quot; as one would normally accept in the agreement of agency. Significantly, the supplies were made to the distributor against payment either immediate or deferred as provided in the agreement, and even when the goods were destined directly to the customer, it was the distributor who had to guarantee to arrange the payment. That where there was some time lag between the sending of the goods and the payment, the goods were to be insured at the cost of the assessee therein. This Court observed that this circumstance clearly showed that in respect of the goods dispatched under orders placed by the distributors, the latter really acted as purchasers of the goods which they in turn sold to the customers and did not merely act as agents of the said company. That in respect of these transactions, the goods dispatched passed to the distributor on the bills being endorsed and handed over to the distributors.

They were given a discount which was on a slab system, such as for the purchase of 50,001 and above tickets, there was a 28% discount. The petitioners contended that the tickets purchased were thereafter distributed to other agents and subagents on commission basis. That after purchase of the tickets, it was not for the Government to look out as to how they were distributed and there was no control over the affairs thereafter.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> That there was only payment of the price of the ticket fixed as payable by the principal, and no commission or discount was paid to them by the Government. That Section 194G of the Income Tax Act, which imposes liability on the person responsible for paying to any person who is or has been stocking, distributing, purchasing or selling lottery tickets, any income by way of commission, remuneration, on such tickets in all amounts exceeding Rs.1000, to deduct income tax thereon at the rate of 10%, had no application. Hence, the demand of tax was without jurisdiction. The Kerala High Court considered the question whether the amount received as commission or discount or any incentive or as a margin is income or earning which was taxable at the hand of the assessee concerned, coming under the purview of Section 194G of the Income Tax Act. It was observed that if the face value of the lottery ticket was Re. 1, the petitioner therein would receive it at Rs. 0.72 paise and could sell at any price and it was not the State's business to enquire into the matter at all. It was observed that the deduction under Section 194G was on any person responsible for paying to any person any income by way of commission, etc. who purchased or sold or stocked lottery tickets, in this case, the State Government. The deduction was to be made at the time of credit of such income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment of such income. The Kerala High Court observed that when the deduction is contemplated at the time of the payment to the person concerned but it is shown that there was no payment to the agent at the time of purchase of the ticket, the section automatically becomes inapplicable. That the ticket is given on a discount of 28%, can by no imagination be pressed into service for an interpretation that, nonetheless, 10% of 28 paise is deductible as tax. Thus, it was held that Section 194G was not applicable. The Kerala High Court held that since the lottery tickets were sold at a discounted price, the purchasers were sought to be taxed as agents which could not be the case as there was no transaction under an agency and the petitioner therein were not liable to be covered under Section 194G of the Income Tax Act.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.7</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> <B>Ahmedabad Stamp Vendors Association vs. Union of India, (2002) 257 ITR 202 (Guj)</B>, raised a question with regard to whether, the petitioners therein being stamp vendors were agents of the State Government who were being paid commission or brokerage or whether the sale of stamp papers by the Government to the licensed vendors was on principal to principal basis involving a contract of sale. Reference was made to Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. and also to the meanings of the expressions &quot;commission&quot; and &quot;discount&quot;. The licensed vendors have to pay for the price of the stamp paperless the discount at the rates provided varying from 0.5% to 4%. It was not that the stamp vendor collected the stamp papers from the Government, sold them to the retail customers and then deposited the sale proceeds with the Government less the discount. The liability of the stamp vendor to pay the price less the discount was not dependent upon or contingent to sale of stamp papers by the licensed vendor. The licensed vendor was not entitled to get any compensation or refund of the price if the stamp papers were lost or destroyed. The crucial question was whether the ownership in the stamp papers passed to the stamp vendor when the Treasury Officer delivered stamp papers on payment of price less discount. Clause (b) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 24 of Gujarat Stamps Supply and Sales Rules, 1987 indicated that the discount which the licensed vendor had obtained from the Government was on purchase of the stamp papers. Consequently, it was held that the discount made available to the stamp vendors under the provisions of the aforesaid 1987 Rules did not fall within the expression &quot;commission&quot; or &quot;brokerage&quot; under Section 194H of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.8</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In <B>Bharti Cellular Limited (Now Bharti Airtel Limited) vs. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, (2024) 8 SCC 608</B>, the assessees therein were cellular mobile service providers and the issue related to the liability to deduct tax at source under Section 194-H of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on the amount which, as per the Revenue, was a commission payable to an agent by the assessees under the franchise/distributorship agreement between the assessees and the franchisees/distributors.

This was specially in the context of the expression &quot;acting on behalf of another person&quot;. Referring to Section 182 of the Contract Act which defines &quot;agent&quot; and &quot;principal&quot;, it was observed that agency is a triangular relationship between the principal, agent and the third party. In order to understand the relationship, one has to examine the inter se relationship between the principal and the third party and the agent and the third party. In this regard, it was observed that certain factors or aspects must be taken into consideration while examining whether a legal relationship of a principal and agent exists, as under:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">(a) &quot;The essential characteristic of an agent is the legal power vested with the agent to alter his principal's legal relationship with a third party and the principal's co-relative liability to have his relations altered.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(b) As the agent acts on behalf of the principal, one of the prime elements of the relationship is the exercise of a degree of control by the principal over the conduct of the activities of the agent. This degree of control is less than the control exercised by the master on the servant, and is different from the rights and obligations in case of principal to principal and independent contractor relationship.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(c) The task entrusted by the principal to the agent should result in a fiduciary relationship. The fiduciary relationship is the manifestation of consent by one person to another to act on his or her behalf and subject to his or her control, and the reciprocal consent by the other to do so.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(d) As the business done by the agent is on the principal's account, the agent is liable to render accounts thereof to the principal. An agent is entitled to remuneration from the principal for the work he performs for the principal.&quot;</P></DIR>
   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.8</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> .1 It was further observed that three other relevant aspects or considerations should be noted. First, is the difference between &quot;power&quot; and &quot;authority&quot;. The second consideration is that the primary task of an agent is to enter into contracts on behalf of his principal, or to dispose of his principal's property. The third consideration is that the substance of the relationship between the parties, notwithstanding the nomenclature given by the parties to the relationship, is of primary importance.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.8.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> 2 In this case, three distinct relationships were considered which are different from the relationship of an agency. The first is the difference between an agent and a servant which is not relevant for this case. Next, the difference between a principal-agent and principal-principal relationship was considered with reference to Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. It was observed that an agent, after taking delivery of the property, does not sell it as his own property but sells the same as the property of the principal and under his instructions and directions. Therefore, if the agent is not the owner of the goods and if any loss is suffered by the agent, he is to be indemnified by the principal. This is unlike a contract of sale where title to the property passes on to the buyer on delivery of the goods for a price paid or promised. The buyer then becomes the owner of the property and the seller has no vestige of title left in the property. Third is the case of independent contractor, wherein if the party is concerned about acting for himself and making the maximum profit possible, he is usually regarded as a buyer or an independent contractor and not as an agent of the principal. This would be true even when certain terms and conditions have been fixed relating to the manner in which the seller conducts his business.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.8.3.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Distinguishing the relationship of a principal with independent contractor from that of an agency, it was observed that an independent contractor is free from control on the part of his employer, and is only subject to the terms of his contract. On the other hand, an agent is not completely free from control, and the relationship to the extent of tasks entrusted by the principal to the agent is fiduciary. Sometimes an independent contractor looks like an agent from the point of view of the control exercisable over him, but on an overview of the entire relationship, it may not be an agency. It was further observed that the distinction is that independent contractors work for themselves even when they are employed for the purpose of creating contractual relations with the third persons. It was further observed that the term &quot;agent&quot; should be restricted to one who has the power of affecting the legal position of his principal by the making of contracts, or the disposition of the principal's property; viz. an independent contractor who may, incidentally, also affect the legal position of his principal in other ways.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Agreements:</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 17.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The relevant Clauses of the agreements which were adverted to before this Court have been extracted above.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 17.1</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In the agreement dated 10.08.2009, the respondent-assessee (M/s Future Gaming Solutions Pvt.

The Sikkim High Court observed that the said clause essentially means the conducting of lotteries within the scope and ambit of betting and gambling as per Entry 62 - List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and therefore, on the very same activity of betting and gambling, service tax cannot be levied.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.2</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The High Court further held that when a sole purchaser/distributor/promoter purchases the lottery tickets from the State Government for the purpose of onward sales through stockists etc., it was not acting as an agent of the State Government but in its own right as a principal. Thus, the relationship between the State Government and the sole distributor was one between a principal and principal and not one between principal and agent. That various clauses of the Agreement indicated that the sole distributor was acting in its own right on purchase of the lottery tickets for onward sales, having regard to the Lotteries Act which is a Central Government legislation and bearing in mind the faith of the general public/customers in the lottery schemes conducted by the Government of Sikkim. It was only for the above purposes that various clauses of the agreement sought to enhance transparency in the lottery business, which was a part of the revenue earning endeavours of the State of Sikkim through various lottery schemes. In the circumstances, the High Court set-aside the demands for payment of service tax made by the Central Government.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.3</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> At the same time, the Finance Act, 2012, by an amendment of Finance Act, 1994, introduced the Negative List under Section 66D which comprised of various services on which no service tax could be levied or collected. The List included the activity of betting, gambling or lottery. Hence, no service tax on the conduct of the lottery could be levied by the Central Government. However, in 2015, another amendment was made to the Finance Act, 1994 by substituting Explanation 2 in clause (44) of Section 65B, wherein the expression &quot;transaction in money or actionable claim&quot; was defined to not include, inter alia, any activity carried out, for a consideration, in relation to, or for facilitation of, a transaction in money or actionable claim including the activity carried out, inter alia, by a lottery distributor or selling agent in relation to promotion, marketing, organizing, selling of lottery or facilitating in organizing of lottery of any kind in any other manner. The expression &quot;lottery distributor or selling agent&quot; was defined by inserting clause (31A) to Section 65B to mean a person appointed or authorized by a State for the purposes of promoting, marketing, selling or facilitating in organizing lottery of any kind, in any manner, organized by such State in accordance with the provisions of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998. Since &quot;betting, gambling or lottery&quot; was included in the Negative List, an Explanation was inserted to Section 66D(i) to say that the said expression &quot;betting, gambling or lottery&quot; shall not include the activity specified in Explanation 2 to clause (44) of Section 65B. Thus, the intent of the Parliament was that any transaction in an actionable claim (lottery being an actionable claim) would not include an activity carried out for the distribution of lottery by the distributor. In other words, such activity of the distributor would not amount to the activity of betting, gambling or lottery.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.4</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> We do not think that such a meaning could be attributed to the activity of the distributor involved in the selling of lottery or facilitating or organizing of lottery in any manner. The expression &quot;betting, gambling or lottery&quot; in the Explanation to Section 66D(i) has to be given its true intent and meaning as conducting a lottery is nothing but an activity coming within the scope of betting and gambling. This is by the application of the principle of noscitur a sociis where the expression &quot;lottery&quot; takes its meaning from &quot;betting and gambling&quot;. Although a lottery ticket is nothing but an actionable claim, the conduct of a lottery scheme is nothing but a betting and gambling activity. Therefore, it is only Entry 62 - List II which enables the imposition of tax by the State Government. The activity of betting and gambling which includes conducting of a lottery is regulated under Entry 34 - List II, with Entry 62 - List II being the taxation entry.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.5</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> By way of Finance Act, 2015, clause (a) of the Explanation to Section 67 containing the definition &quot;consideration&quot; was amended to include, inter alia, any amount retained by the lottery distributor or selling agent from gross sale of lottery tickets in addition to the fee or commission, if any, or, as the case may be, the discount received, i.e., the difference in the face value of the lottery ticket and the price at which the distributor or selling agent gets that ticket. The said amendment would have no consequence and bearing on the substantive provisions for the reasons that we have stated above. This is because the distributor buys at wholesale price from the State Government and sells it at a higher price to the retailer.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.6</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Thereafter, the amendment made to clause [ii(a)] of the Explanation 2 to Section 65B(44) in the year 2016 that the expression &quot;transaction in money or actionable claim&quot; would not include any activity carried out, for a consideration, in relation to, or for facilitation of, a transaction in money or actionable claim, including the activity carried out, inter alia, by a lottery distributor or selling agent on behalf of the State Government, in relation to promotion, marketing, etc. in accordance with the provisions of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 is only an innocuous amendment which is only cosmetic in nature.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.7</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In the circumstances, we find that at each stage, the amendments made to the Finance Act, 1994, in order to impose service tax on the sole distributor/purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) have been unsuccessful. We have reasoned that the amendment to the said definition would in no way detract from the substance of the relationship between the State Government and the sole distributor or purchaser of the lottery tickets which is one of principal to principal and not of principal-agent. There being no agency and no service rendered by the respondents-assessees herein as an agent to the Government of Sikkim, service tax is not leviable on the transactions between the purchaser of the lottery tickets (respondents-assessees herein) and the Government of Sikkim.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 19.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The detailed analysis of the relevant provisions of the Finance Act, 1994, and amendments made thereto in light of the clauses of the Agreements highlighted during the course of submissions as well as the judgments of this Court, would not persuade us to take a different view from what the Sikkim High Court has taken.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 20.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In view of the aforesaid discussion, we find no merit in the appeals filed by the Union of India and others.
