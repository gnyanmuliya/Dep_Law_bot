No such permission was sought or granted. In fact, CoC had already approved the Resolution Plan on 28.10.2022, i.e., much before AGI Greenpac proposed modifications on 10.03.2023.

The CCI's approval on 15.03.2023 also acknowledged that even after divestment, it must be demonstrated that the same is aligned with its approval. The plan creates an unfeasible sequence, as the divestment depends on the Resolution Plan's implementation, which itself requires prior CCI approval, leading to unfeasible complications, which should have been avoided by the NCLAT.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 19.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Appearing for the CoC, Mr. Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General, inter alia, made the following submissions:</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 19.1.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The IBC was introduced as an experiment to facilitate debt-ridden companies, to be taken over as going concerns, by avoiding liquidation.

The question of obtaining approval from the CCI only arises when Resolution Plan submitted contains a combination and require approval from the CCI. After submission of Plan, the Resolution Applicant applies for approval of combination from the CCI. It is not in his hand that as to when CCI will grant the approval. The CCI has to act as per statutory provisions of the Competition Act and it has been given 210 days to take a decision. If, we hold that prior approval of the CCI is mandatory prior to the approval of Plan by the CoC, it will lead to incongruous result, the CIRP cannot be frozen or cannot be put at halt because an application is submitted before the CCI. Looking to the timeline provided in the Code and that of the Competition Act and to hold that prior approval of CCI is required prior to approval of Plan by the CoC, mandatorily will lead to adverse effect on the CIRP.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">.... 34. In the present case, we have noticed that RFRP provided that CCI's approval has to be obtained prior to approval of Plan by the CoC, which RFRP was in accordance with Section 31(4).

Such a conclusion was reached on the understanding that the Resolution Applicant does not have control over the timeline within which the CCI may render its approval or disapproval, towards the combination application. This may in turn, lead to a situation wherein the insolvency proceeding is unduly delayed because of a pending application seeking approval from the CCI.

It is not possible to decide whether certain words are plain or ambiguous unless they are studied in the context and construed. The rule, therefore, in reality means that after you have construed the words and have come to the conclusion that they can bear only one meaning, your duty is to give effect to that meaning... ...</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">... ...That seems to me a plain clear meaning of the statutory language in its context.

This involves far more than picking out dictionary definitions of words or expressions used. Consideration of the context and setting is indispensable properly to ascertain a meaning. In saying that a verbal expression is plain or unambiguous, we mean little more than that we are convinced that virtually anyone competent to understand it and desiring fairly and impartially to ascertain its significance would attribute to the expression in its context a meaning such as the one we derive, rather than any other; and would consider any different meaning by comparison, strained, or far-fetched, or unusual or unlikely.&quot;</FONT><B>[14]</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">[13]</B> Pg. 41, 1.6.

However, the Committee was of the opinion that approval from CCI may be dealt through specific regulations for fast tracking the approval process in consultation with the CCI. The Committee was informed that pursuant to discussions with CCI, it has been agreed that CCI will have a period of 30 working days for approval of combinations arising out of the Code, from the date of filing of the combination notice to the CCI. Further, this timeline of 30 days may be extended by another 30 days, only in exceptional cases. In the event that no approval or rejection is provided by the CCI within the aforementioned timelines, the said combination would be deemed to have been approved.

In case of other statutory bodies, a timeline of one year subsequent to the CoC's approval of the Resolution Plan was deemed to be sufficient, whereas the timeline for procuring the CCI's approval was brought ahead in the sense that the same was required to be obtained prior to the approval of the Resolution Plan, by the COC.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 70.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The statute, as can be observed, provided a different threshold for the CCI's approval as compared to approvals to be received from other statutory and regulatory bodies.

The phrase is thus a term of art, referring to a particular sort of legislative mistake. Specifically, and as explained more fully throughout Part I, a &quot;scrivener's error&quot; is a case in which the words of a legislative text diverge from what Congress meant to say.

While the legislative intent behind CIRP is to create a process characterised with finality and decisiveness, conditional approval appears to be a perilous deviation from the stated objectives. As underscored in the CCI's conditional approval order, the order remains subject to revocation if the information furnished by the parties is later found to be inaccurate. This acknowledgment, however, exposes the system's vulnerability to abuse or misrepresentation, particularly in the absence of a system, enforcing checks and balances. Further, such a conditional approval can foster uncertainty, prolong negotiations, and necessitate further modifications, thereby putting at peril the sanctity of the resolution framework.</FONT><B>[41]</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">[41]</B> <B>Ebix Singapore Pvt.

 </FONT><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">CONCLUSION</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 148.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> As India aspires to establish itself as a global manufacturing powerhouse and investment hub, it is imperative that it is able to provide a reliable, robust and competitive business environment for both domestic and international stakeholders. In essence, the introduction of the Green Channel route, which strives to create a level-playing field and enable new entrants to effectively compete with established players in the Indian market, is a significant step in that direction. However, to ensure that entities operate with utmost confidence in the sanctity and fairness of India's legal and regulatory system, the objectives of the IBC and the Competition Act must also necessarily be in harmony with one another.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 149.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Within that context, while the IBC's primary objective is the timely resolution of stressed assets with maximised value realisation for the stakeholders, the significant delay seen in the present case is both unfortunate and regrettable. Nevertheless, expeditious resolution cannot come at the cost of disregarding statutory provisions. Providing relief for stressed assets must necessarily align with the statutory framework, as adherence to legal principles is fundamental to a fair and just resolution process.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 150.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In the present case, for reasons discussed above, the statutory provision and legislative intent unequivocally affirm the mandatory nature of the proviso to Section 31(4) of the IBC. For a Resolution Plan containing a combination, the CCI's approval to the Resolution Plan, in our opinion, must be obtained before and consequently, the CoC's examination and approval should be only after the CCI's decision. This interpretation respects the original legislative intent, and deviation from the same would not only undermine the statute but would also erode the faith posed by the stakeholders in the integrity of our legal and regulatory framework.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 151.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Where the provisions allow for dilution or departure from the intended scheme of the IBC or the Competition Act, it is the responsibility of the legislature to rectify such inconsistencies through appropriate legislative measures and the judiciary should not normally venture into the legislative domain.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 152.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Further, the indispensability of procedural safeguards as an integral component of a just legal order must be given its due weight, especially as procedural requirements are not mere formalities to be circumvented for expediency but substantive protections designed to ensure fairness and transparency. In that light, the procedural lapses with respect to objections to the proposed combination and the consequent divestiture modification proposed within the framework of the Competition Act, 2002, seriously vitiated the integrity of the process. It is therefore reiterated and reinforced that adherence to procedural propriety is non-negotiable and that the ends cannot justify the means.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 153.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> By upholding the mandatory nature of the statutory provision and emphasising upon the critical importance of procedural safeguards, the principle of rule of law is upheld in alignment with global best practices which underscore fairness, predictability and transparency. Such an approach not only reinforces the integrity and credibility of the legal framework but also highlights India's commitment to fostering a regulatory environment, which is conducive to both business and innovation. Additionally, it also ensures the protection and enforcement of rights in an equitable manner, free from bias or favouritism.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 154.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Therefore, a balance between the need for expeditious relief and adherence to the statutory framework must necessarily be maintained, in order to ensure that the objectives of both, the IBC and the Competition Act are met in a manner that supports India's long-term economic aspirations.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 155.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The upshot of the above discussion are the following orders:</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 155.1.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The AGI Greenpac's Resolution Plan is unsustainable as it failed to secure prior approval from the CCI, as mandated under the proviso to Section 31(4) of the IBC.

The re-negotiating process is known as the &quot;Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process&quot;. The primary object of this effort, briefly stated, is the value maximization of the corporate debtor. The CIRP keeps the corporate debtor as a going concern and runs on the theory that the value of the business is worth more than the realisation of the piecemeal distribution of assets. However, if this objective cannot be achieved, the best outcome for society is the rapid liquidation of a failing corporate debtor.

The relevant paragraphs read thus:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;it is clear that when the Committee of Creditors exercises its commercial wisdom to arrive at a business decision to revive the corporate debtor, it must necessarily take into account these key features of the Code before it arrives at a commercial decision to pay off the dues of financial and operational creditors. There is no doubt whatsoever that the ultimate discretion of what to pay and how much to pay each class or subclass of creditors is with the Committee of Creditors, but, the decision of such Committee must reflect the fact that it has taken into account maximising the value of the assets of the corporate debtor and the fact that it has adequately balanced the interests of all stakeholders including operational creditors. This being the case, judicial review of the Adjudicating Authority that the resolution plan as approved by the Committee of Creditors has met the requirements referred to in Section 30(2) would include judicial review that is mentioned in Section 30(2)(e), as the provisions of the Code are also provisions of law for the time being in force. Thus, while the Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with the commercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, the limited judicial review available is to see that the Committee of Creditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtor needs to keep going as a going concern during the insolvency resolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets; and that the interests of all stakeholders including operational creditors has been taken care of. If the Adjudicating Authority finds, on a given set of facts, that the aforesaid parameters have not been kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to the Committee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying the aforesaid parameters. The reasons given by the Committee of Creditors while approving a resolution plan may thus be looked at by the Adjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it is satisfied that the Committee of Creditors has paid attention to these key features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other things being equal.&quot;</P></DIR>

The golden rule is that the words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning. It is yet another rule of construction that when the words of the statute are clear, plain and unambiguous, then the courts are bound to give effect to that meaning, irrespective of the consequences. It is said that the words themselves best declare the intention of the lawgiver. The courts have adhered to the principle that efforts should be made to give meaning to each and every word used by the legislature and it is not a sound principle of construction to brush aside words in a statute as being inapposite surpluses, if they can have a proper application in circumstances conceivable within the contemplation of the statute. &quot; (emphasis supplied)</P> </FONT><B><p style="Text-align : justify">[12]</B> (2001) 4 SCC 534.</P></DIR>

If the word &quot;retiring&quot; was capable of being read as &quot;retired&quot; (sometime in the past) then there would have been no occasion to use &quot;renomination&quot; in the construction of the sentence. If the intention of law-framers would have been not to permit a person to be a member of the Council for more than two terms in his lifetime then a different, better and stronger framing of the provision was expected.

This statement is more so if it refers to legislative intent or purpose manifested in the only manner in which a legislature can authoritatively do so in the text of the enactment. Though not to find out violability in the text of the enactment, but to keep the content consistent throughout the enactment - the court gathers the meaning of all the expressions used in the same section. In this manner, the courts have applied grammatical construction to provisions of law.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 68.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In sub-section (2) of section 31, the words &quot;does not confirm to the requirements of sub-section (1) of section 31&quot; grammatically interpreted throw light on the stage of satisfactory compliance of all the requirements of subsection (2) of section 30. The Parliament, in its wisdom, would have employed the expression &quot;did not&quot; in place of &quot;does not&quot; if the requirement is that the resolution plan is fully compliant at a stage before consideration of the resolution plans by the CoC. As part of the interpretative process, the Court ought not to lose sight of expressions which are in the present tense, such as &quot;meets&quot;, &quot;does not&quot;, and &quot;satisfies&quot; in section 31 of the IBC. The word &quot;confirm&quot; literally means &quot;to verify&quot; for both positive recordings of requirements of subsection (1) of section 31 and also negative recordings of omissions or illegality in the resolution plans voted by the CoC. There is no ambiguity that when subsection (1) of section 31 is referred to in both the eventualities stated above, it includes clause (e) of section 30(2) of the IBC. The above literal construction, as has been canvassed by the appellants, must be applied to the entire scheme of sections 30 and 31 and not merely in isolation to the proviso to sub-section (4) of section 31 of the IBC. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 31 obligate the Adjudicating Authority in its jurisdiction to decide these aspects and consider whether approval should be granted or rejected.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 69.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The consequences of approval are also set out in sub-section (1) of section 31, including transferring the business of the corporate debtor to a successful resolution applicant. Sub-section (4) grants a window of one year to the successful resolution applicant for obtaining permissions, licenses or permits under applicable laws. These are ex post facto operational permissions/consents/licences needed to run the business as a going concern by the successful resolution applicant and to avoid civil or penal consequences. Sub-section (4) provides for a legal fiction to continue to operate with the existing permissions/licences/consents in favour of the corporate debtor from a host of authorities by the successful resolution applicant.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 70.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Whereas the meaning, definition and implication of combination attracting sections 5 and 6 of the Competition Act are distinct. By keeping in perspective the language of sections 5 and 6 of the Competition Act, the combination should have the approval of CCI on the day on which the resolution applicant receives approval under section 31(1) of IBC. In the alternative, the absence of combination approval would result in the combination being void. The successful resolution applicant cannot be allowed to take over the management awaiting orders of CCI, and the successful resolution applicant cannot undertake business operations. The memorandum and notes on clauses appended to the ordinance and amendment recognised the need for statutory protection and the need for due compliance with statutory requirements of approval of combination under the Competition Act by the successful resolution applicant. There is an inconsistency and ambiguity in the stage of having CCI approval. In such cases, the text of the amended and unamended sections should guide the interpretation.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 71.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Section 30(4) does not obligate the CoC to examine whether the resolution plan contravenes the requirements of section 30(2)(e) of the IBC. The comprehensive proposals submitted by the RP and the resolution of the CoC will disclose feasibility and viability. The proposal of the successful resolution applicant being legally compliant in a CIRP attracting CCI's approval for combination is examined by the Adjudicating Authority.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 72.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> <B>Essar Steel </B>(supra) has laid down as a clear principle or ratio that the CoC is primarily concerned with feasibility, viability and the manner of distribution proposed, etc., amongst the creditors and may keep in mind section 53(1) of the Code. The insistence upon approval of CCI before CIRP reaches section 30(4) would limit the number of eligible resolution applicants, and the core objects of CIRP, intended to benefit the stakeholders through maximization of recovery, is defeated. Noted from the sense of commercial prudence, unless the resolution plan is acceptable to the CoC, a question arises as to the prudence for a business entity to move the CCI for approval. Through the Amendment Act, the proviso to subsection (4) has been inserted within section 31. If the timing of having approval of the combination is at the stage where the CoC is considering the resolution plans, then the insertion would have been in section 30, but not as is reflected in the amended section 31 of the IBC. Stepping up the requirement to a stage not envisaged by the parliament, particularly not resulting in a consequence for not having the approval of CCI, would be akin to writing too much into the sentence. In this context, if the requirement of approval of combination at the stage of CoC is held as mandatory, then through a literal interpretation of the proviso to section 31(4), the Court would be catapulting the proviso to a place not expressed by the parliament. Precisely reiterated, such interpretation, apart from causing difficulties in CIRP defeats the very object of maximization of recovery.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 73.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In contradistinction, section 31(4) specifically refers to due compliance with the requirements of sub-section (1) of section 31, which then refers to the requirements in sub-section (2) of section 30 with regard to approval of the resolution plan. The statutory compliance by the resolution applicant is divided into two stages viz., firstly, sub-section (4) provides a window time of one year to obtain necessary approval under any law by the resolution applicant; and secondly, having the combination approval before sub-section (2) of section 31 of IBC. This said compliance status enables the Adjudicating Authority to accept or reject a resolution plan which does not confirm to the requirements referred to in sub-section (1) of section 31. The final consideration of the resolution plans before the Adjudicating Authority arises in the manner laid down by this Court in <B>Essar Steel </B>(supra). The absence or presence of combination approval while a decision is taken under sub-section (4) of section 30 is not very relevant from the perspective of feasibility or viability. The Adjudicating Authority, if it is satisfied that the resolution plan has provisions for effective implementation, then one facet of verification is over. After which, it is verified whether to reject the resolution plan for not confirming to the requirements referred to in sub-section (1) of section 31. To wit, it is noted as an example that a resolution applicant gets into the management of the corporate debtor by an order under section 31(1) of the IBC, and has combination approval for the resolution plan on that day, then the consequence of section 6 of the Competition Act, namely the combination being void, is not attracted. The purpose and object of the IBC and the subsequent amendments are to provide theoretical and practical resolution to the financial difficulties of a stressed corporate debtor for the benefit of the stakeholders of the corporate debtor. The statutory scheme is not intended to give undue advantage or hardship to the resolution applicants.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 74.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Yet another reason taken note is that as per the statutory scheme, the resolution plan receives two kinds of approvals, one by the CoC under subsection (4) of section 30 primarily on feasibility and viability and another from the Adjudicating Authority that the resolution plan has provisions for its effective implementation and that the resolution plan confirms to sub-section (2) of section 30, including clause (e). The proviso to sub-section (4) of section 31 needs to be carefully examined. It may be noted that the proviso to sub-section (4) of section 31 refers only to a resolution plan containing a provision for combination.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 75.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The question as to whether a requirement under the statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed.

Further, presenting the combination approval at the stage of consideration by the Adjudicating Authority under section 31(1) and (2) does not diminish the value of the stressed assets because of robust competition among eligible resolution applicants. Further, the opportunity cost that arises from treating the stage at which combination approval is required as mandatory may disturb the smooth working of the intricate and competitive insolvency resolution system that the IBC envisages. Thus, the consequences of compliance and non-compliance with all the legal requirements of the resolution plan arise only before the Adjudicating Authority. Consequently, to keep section 31 uniform in all perspectives, it is concluded that in the place of literal interpretation, purposive interpretation is apt; therefore, the word 'shall' in the proviso to section 31(4) of the IBC is interpreted and held as directory.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 79.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> From the above discussion, it is held that the proviso to sub-section (4) of section 31 is directory and would be compliant with IBC and the Competition Act. Hence, the combination approval of CCI at the stage of consideration of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority under section 31(1) would be proper and legal. Such interpretation keeps the operations of the successful resolution applicant as a going concern, without deviating from the rigour of the Competition Act, and simultaneously, a one-year window is granted to obtain licenses, permissions, consents and other regulatory approvals envisaged by a host of laws. Therefore, the proviso is interpreted purposively and held that the approval of a combination of CCI at the stage of consideration by CoC is directory and not mandatory. By operation of section 31(2) of the IBC, to avoid rejection of a fully compliant and voted resolution plan, the Adjudicating Authority confirms that the approval of the combination is available before implementing the resolution plan. At best, the use of the words &quot;prior to&quot; is a temporal expression whose mandatory or directory nature is to be determined from the context surrounding section 31.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 80.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> IBC and the Competition Act have timelines for the discharge of a duty and function.

The argument of the appellant is that the confirmation of a view taken by the NCLAT, as above, is either distinguishable or alternatively cannot be treated as a binding precedent for deciding the controversy in these appeals. In reply, it is argued that the NCLAT has considered the crux of the issue in these matters and the Civil Appeal(s) that stood dismissed has the effect of a binding precedent on the question of whether the proviso to sub-section (4) of section 31 of the IBC is mandatory or directory. The absence of a reasoned dismissal order is no reason to re-open an otherwise established position of law.

The resolution applicant is not to be subjected to intolerable uncertainty or not knowing what comes next. While doubt is not a pleasant condition, the adjudicatory process should not multiply it.

Further consideration by the Adjudicating Authority is paused because of an interlocutory application, an appeal to the NCLAT, and the subsequent proceedings in this Court. The resolution plans were submitted with the contemporaneous perspective of the physical state of affairs of men, machinery and matters of the corporate debtor. The delay loses the very sheen in the effort to revive the stressed assets of a corporate debtor. The law provides for availing legal remedies. It may not be understood as laying down that the interlocutory applications are not maintainable before the Adjudicating Authority and NCLAT. Parties are well within their competence to move an application, including further statutory remedies under IBC in accordance with law. The outcome must be met with consequences and costs for the unsuccessful parties. The consequences of delay must also be borne in mind.

The failure of the resolution process will finally result in the sale of scrap of the assets of the corporate debtor, and again, a scenario experienced under previous regimes is reflected. It is axiomatic, more particularly in commercial matters, that costs and consequences of adjudication follow the event. In corporate and commercial matters, as a corollary, the cost must follow the result.

The CCI appreciated the combined market share of HNGIL and AGI in the delineated relevant market as - (i) Alco-Beverage (40-50%) and (ii) F&amp;B (80-85%). The combined effect of AGI and HNGIL is noted as significant players in the Alco Beverage and F&amp;B Sector.

In this factual matrix, the CCI, as a regulatory statutory body, conforms to all the prescriptions of law under sections 20, 29, and 31 of the Competition Act and regulation 19 of Combination Regulations 2011. The CCI examined the details of the acquirer and the target in a perfunctory manner.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 19.5.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The assessment of AAEC by CCI ignored the manufacturing capacity of AGI or HNGIL in the relevant product market. The data relied on by CCI is not accurate, and the AAEC is arrived on the TPD of relevant products but not on the installed capacity of the respective units or consented capacity of AGI or HNGIL under various enactments. Looking from such a perspective, the hiving off the Rishikesh Plant through a voluntary modification of the combination plan is illegal and assuming without admitting the Rishikesh Plant could be hived off as part of the modification, the resultant diminishing effect on AAEC within the relevant product market would be negligible.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 19.6.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In other words, the prima facie opinion formed by CCI under section 29(1) remains intact warranting investigation.

The steps envisaged in section 29(1A) are triggered only if the response is not satisfactory. Section 29(1A) uses the word 'may call for a report from the DG, and the DG shall submit the report within the time granted. Therefore, if the response of the parties is satisfactory, then the other stages do not arise. Explained further, if the CCI is satisfied with the response or modification of the combination already suggested, then the CCI is not under an obligation to order notice to the Director General or order parties to advertise the details of the proposed combination. The information and its veracity, as part of the regulatory mechanisms, is one of trust, and the information is relied upon to conform to the timelines stipulated by the Competition Act.

As part of the inquisitorial exercise, the CCI verifies and applies the threshold of precautionary principle to understand whether AAEC in the proposed combination would arise or not. If section 29 is worded such that in all the cases where prima facie opinion is formed, the corollary of forming such opinion leads to calling for the DG's report, directing parties to publish details, then the expression as contained in section 29 would have been different. Section 29(1) of the Competition Act, as worded by the parliament, provides for formation of prima facie opinion, issuance of show cause notice and receiving a reply from the party. The intermediary step of show cause notice and reply provides an opportunity to satisfactorily explain the doubts entertained by CCI while forming the prima facie opinion on AAEC.

The case of both AGI and CCI is that CCI's regulatory jurisdiction for deciding on the approval of a combination was satisfied with the reply/modification suggested, resulting in the combination approval Dt. 15.03.2023. The argument of the appellants is that once a show cause notice is issued under section 29(1), CCI should have called for a report from the Director General. This argument is untenable and rejected accordingly.

The core legal dispute centers on section 29(1) of the Competition Act and its procedure, specifically the phrase &quot;is likely to cause or has caused appreciable adverse effect on competition within the relevant market in India". The CCI initially issued a show cause notice, a preliminary investigative step requiring parties to justify why an in-depth examination of the proposed combination should not be conducted.

The CCI has jurisdiction upon being satisfied with the response as per the scheme of the section to not proceed further. The argument of the appellants would result in the show cause notice being treated as a decision to investigate the Form II application filed for approval of a combination.

The CCI, at the stage of section 29(1), having issued a show cause notice, is entitled to objectively consider the reply given by the parties and, if not satisfied, then take the enquiry into the stage of investigation under section 29(1) to (3) of the Competition Act.

CCI, assailing the said finding, contends that the statutory obligation to issue notice to CCI arises under section 6(2) on the acquirer in the case of acquisition and all parties to the combination. Section 6(2) read with regulation 9(1) and (2) of the Combination Regulations 2011, stipulates the obligation to file notice on the parties to the combination. The statutory Forms I and II of Schedule II throw light on the obligation to file notice under section 6(2). According to CCI, notice to the acquirer in a combination case arising through CIRP is sufficient. Consequently, When the CCI forms its prima facie opinion under section 29(1) read with regulation 19(1) of Combination Regulations 2011, the CCI is required to issue notice only to the acquirer. Moreover, the CCI contends that issuing notice to the corporate debtor in the resolution process is not provided for under the Act and the Regulations. CCI refers to and relies on sections 43(a), 44 and 45 of the Competition Act to provide apposite context for its decision to issue notice only to the acquirer and not to the target company.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 33.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> After perusing the findings recorded by the NCLAT, we are of the view that in cases such as the present, the CCI must issue notice to the acquirer and also the target, i.e., the corporate debtor subjected to the resolution process represented by an RP. Irrespective of different statutory schemes in the sections relied on by CCI, it can be said that the words &quot;it shall issue notice to the parties to show cause&quot; cannot be restricted only to the proposed acquirer. If the plural expression on a case-to-case basis is understood as singular, then it would restrict the meaning of the language. Hence, the findings recorded by the NCLAT are affirmed. It is a matter of record that the RP, taking note of the approval of the combination proposed by AGI, filed an application before the Adjudicating Authority on 08.04.2024 for taking on file the approval of the combination and in the pending issues under section 31 of IBC. Whether the non-issuance of notice to the RP is a ground available to the appellants to challenge the approval of the combination is yet another question which is not considered and decided by the NCLAT.

 </FONT>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 36.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The appellants argue that CCI's consideration of AGI's data is inaccurate or lopsided. CCI consists of experts and specialists in different branches of trade, commerce and technology. The consideration by the experts, as rightly noted by NCLAT, must be given due weightage. In an appeal under section 53T of the Competition Act, the data details need not be reconsidered, and findings need not be recorded on whether the proposed combination has AAEC in the relevant market in India. The counsel appearing for the objectors tried to point out the TPD taken note of by CCI and the capacity of HNGIL and AGI. AAEC, as determined by the CCI, considers the product outflow from the acquirer and the target. These factors determined the market share and AAEC in the relevant market in India. Established, installed or consented capacities are permissions held by a business entity. From the permission granted for higher capacity, AAEC is not appreciated until the capacity is used to the maximum by the enterprise. There is no ground to re-examine the issues in fact. The consideration and conclusion recorded by CCI, as confirmed by NCLAT, are affirmed; consequently, the appeals are dismissed.</P> <B><P ALIGN="CENTER">*ORDER*</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Per Hrishikesh Roy,  J.</b><BR><BR><TABLE border=0 cols=2 cellPadding=8 cellSpacing=0 width="97%"><tr><td width="50" valign=TOP></td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p style="Text-align : justify"> 1. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">In these matters, the three of us could not reach a common conclusion.

However, such differences must be understood as useful steps towards the evolution of jurisprudence in the field of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and the Competition Act, 2002. In that context, I am reminded of the quote from Shakespeare's &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; the theme of which we do not necessarily endorse.
