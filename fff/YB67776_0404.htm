Pursuant thereto, on 28th November 2014, the NCTE in supersession of the previous regulations prescribed the 2014 NCTE Regulations. It is relevant to note that Clause 9 of the 2014 NCTE Regulations provides the &quot;Norms and Standards&quot; that every institution offering the teacher education programmes, as specified in Appendix 1 to 15 thereto shall have to comply with. Appendix 2 concerns the D. El. Ed. which is a 2-year professional programme that aims to prepare teachers for classes I to VIII. Appendix 9 is concerned with D. El. Ed. through ODL System and it is having duration of 2 academic sessions/years. It can, therefore, be seen that the D. El.

In order to give a statutory effect to the aforesaid letter, the Parliament carried out an Amendment in the RTE Act. The Act No. 24 of 2017 (2017 Amendment Act), therefore, added a second proviso to subsection (2) of Section 23 of the RTE Act and the same was notified on 10th August 2017 by way of a Gazette Notification.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 14.</td><td valign="top"> It is pertinent to note that the second proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the RTE Act provides that every teacher appointed or in position as on 31st March 2015, who does not possess minimum qualifications shall acquire such minimum qualifications within a period of 4 years from the date of commencement of the 2017 Amendment Act. Accordingly, the date of commencement of the 2017 Amendment Act being 1st April 2015, the in-service untrained elementary teachers had to acquire the minimum qualifications by 31st March 2019.

It is further submitted that under Clause 4 of the 2014 Regulations, power is granted to NCTE to relax some of the provisions of the Regulations for such time period and subject to such conditions and limitations as it may consider necessary. It further provides that no relaxation would be granted under the Regulations with regard to minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers for Level 3 (Class I to VIII) as specified in the First Schedule. <B>It is further submitted that NCTE recognition order dated 22nd September 2017 for conducting D.El.Ed. programme by NIOS through ODL mode through the SWAYAM portal of the MHRD was only for the in-service Untrained Teachers at elementary level working in Government, Government Aided and Unaided Private Schools appointed on or before 10th August 2017.

   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 43.</td><td valign="top"> It can thus clearly be seen that as on 6th September 2019, it is also the view of the NCTE that the minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers for Class I to VIII is a 2 years Diploma in Elementary Education. <B>It further clarifies that NCTE recognition order dated 22nd September 2017 was only for those untrained in-service teachers in Government/ Government Aided/ Unaided Private Schools, who were appointed on or before 10th August 2017</B>. It further clarifies that for fresh appointment of teachers for Primary and Upper Primary level, NCTE notifications dated 23rd August 2010 and 29th July 2011 need to be strictly adhered to. It is further to be noted that whereas notifications dated 23rd August 2010 and 29th July 2011 specifically refer to powers conferred under sub-section (1) of Section 23 of the RTE Act, NCTE recognition order dated 22nd September 2017 refers only to the directives issued by MHRD under Section 29 of the NCTE Act.</P> <B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 44.</td><td valign="top"> It is thus clear that the entire scheme was for the purpose of providing a window to the in-service teachers inasmuch as unless they would have acquired requisite qualifications prior to 1st April 2019, they could not have continued to remain in service and would have faced dismissal from service</B>. As such, we find that the High Court has erred in holding that the 18 months Diploma conducted by NIOS through ODL mode is equivalent to 2 years Diploma as provided in the notifications of NCTE dated 23rd August 2010 and 29th July 2011.&quot; (emphasis supplied)</P></DIR>    </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 26.</td><td valign="top"> It can thus be seen that this Court observed that since the time gap between the directions issued by Central Government (MHRD) and 31st March 2019 was only about 18 months, the period of the course was reduced from 2 years to 18 months. It can further be seen that this Court recorded that around 12,91,880 inservice elementary teachers had registered and made payment on the NIOS portal as on the 30th September 2017. Not only that but this Court also observed that the NCTE Recognition Order dated 22nd September 2017 was only for those untrained in-service teachers in Government/Government Aided/Unaided Private Schools, who were appointed on or before 10th August 2017.

However, the Court clarified that the said Recognition Order did not act as a direction to the State of Uttarakhand to act in contravention of its 2012 Service Rules and the advertisement issued on the basis of such Service Rules. In that light therefore this Court came to a finding that the decision of the Uttarakhand High Court to hold the 18 months D. El. Ed. (ODL) through NIOS as equivalent to the 2 years D. El. Ed. (Appendix 2 of 2014 NCTE Regulations) or 2 years D. El.

Having availed of the one-time scheme, such of the teachers even though they only undertook the 18 months D. El. Ed. programme through NIOS they should be considered at par with a 2 years D. El. Ed., if they completed their 18 months programme through NIOS prior to 1st April 2019.

In view of what has been held by this Court hereinabove, we find that the High Court erred in holding that 18 months Diploma conducted by NIOS through ODL mode is equivalent to the 2 years regular Diploma, particularly so, when there was no material placed on record to even remotely hold that such a qualification was recommended by the Expert Body NCTE. On the contrary, the communication dated 6th September 2019 of NCTE, the directives of MHRD so also the recognition order dated 22nd September 2017 clearly go on to show that the 18 months Diploma was provided as a one time window to the in-service teachers to acquire the minimum qualifications between the 2017 Amendment Act and the outer limit of 1st April 2019. In our considered view, the High Court has totally erred in holding that the 2 years Diploma is equivalent to 18 months Diploma.&quot;</P></DIR>

Further, the learned Judge observed that the D. El. Ed. offered by NIOS having a course period of 18 months under the ODL Mode is not recognized as a valid training qualification for recruitment to the post of Primary Teachers in India. Ultimately, the learned Judge directed the WBBPE<B> to not recruit</B> any teachers holding D. El.

As such, any teacher who was inservice as on 10th August 2017 and who acquired the qualification of D. El.
