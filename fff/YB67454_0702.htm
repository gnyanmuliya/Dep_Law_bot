Since there is no any specific rules in this regard and as per practice the same was done with a view that in case the counsel mention regarding the said document before the Hon'ble Court during the proceeding, the same must be available to the Hon'ble Court to avoid any inconvenience to the Hon'ble Court.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">Inconvenience caused to the Hon'ble Court is deeply regretted.&quot;</P></DIR>
   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 3. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">It may be noted that as per the Office Report dated 13.11.2024 the learned Advocate Mr. Ayush Anand had on 26.07.2024 filed an application registered as I.A. No. 161791/2024, seeking permission to implead the complainant as the respondent No. 2 in the SLP. Along with the said Application, he also filed a counter affidavit along with seven documents/annexures on behalf of the said applicant/complainant. It hardly needs to be stated that unless the applicant was permitted to be impleaded by the Court and unless he was permitted to file counter affidavit or the documents, the concerned Section/Branch of the Registry could not have accepted the said counter affidavit or the documents from the proposed party, and made such counter/documents part of the record. When the applicant was not a party respondent in the SLP, he could not have filed either the counter affidavit or presented any documents along therewith. It is very unfortunate that the concerned Dealing Assistant has tried to justify the lapse quoting the practice prevailing in the Registry, and the concerned Branch Officer and the Assistant Registrar have simply put their signatures on such unacceptable justification.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 4. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">This Court has time and again observed that the concerned Section/Branch of the Registry is accepting the documents/reply/counter from the party, who would not be a party -respondent in the proceedings nor would he have filed any caveat.
