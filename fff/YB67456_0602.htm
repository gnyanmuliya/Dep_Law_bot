In some instances, Secretaries of the STA or RTAs granted these permits, relying on purported delegations under Rule 56. Meanwhile, KSRTC and its employees' federation filed various writ petitions challenging (a) the validity of the 2003 Repeal Act and (b) the power of the Secretaries to grant permits. They argued that the 1976 Act, having been upheld by the Supreme Court, could not be repealed without fresh Presidential assent, and contended that awarding permit granting power which was quasi judicial to a single officer ought to remain vested only in multi-member bodies.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 4.8.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In a judgment and order dated 17 November 2004 in W.P.

On 16 December 2004, the Learned Single Judge of the High Court ruled that the repeal of the KCCA Act by Act No. 9/2003 is unconstitutional. Citing the decisions in <B>Ranganatha Reddy</B> (supra) and <B>Vijayakumar Sharma</B> (supra), the Judge observed that the State Government lacks the authority to repeal an Act that has received the President's assent. Since the KCCA Act falls under Entry 42 of the Concurrent List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, Act No. 9/2003 was required to be sent for the President's assent. It further noted that, by repealing the KCCA, the objective of the State Transport Undertaking could not be achieved, and that the issue could have been resolved by granting additional permits to the State Transport Corporation.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 4.9.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> <B>Reference to Division Bench</B>- Ultimately, appeals (W.A.

It reasoned that the Legislature had plenary power to repeal a statute if it fell within its legislative domain. The bench also noted that since the 1976 Act had been validly enacted under Entry 42 of List III (Concurrent List), the State Government was equally competent to repeal it, without requiring a fresh reference to the President for assent. The Court disagreed with the contention that repealing an Act previously upheld by the Supreme Court amounted to &quot;overruling&quot; the Supreme Court. Once the 1976 Act had been constitutionally affirmed, the Legislature's power to modify or repeal it remained unimpaired, subject only to not violating fundamental or constitutional rights.</P> <B><p style="Text-align : justify">Delegation of Permit-Granting Power to the Secretary</B>- The Division Bench, however, rejected the argument that the STA (or RTA) could delegate contract carriage permit issuance to the Secretary. It held that permit granting under Chapter V is a quasi-judicial function requiring collective adjudication or at least decision-making by the statutory authority itself. The High Court thus invalidated the relevant portion of the KMV Rules (Rule 56) or, more precisely, the manner in which the STA had invoked it. The Division Bench concluded that the &quot;Secretary alone&quot; approach improperly bypassed the multimember scheme envisaged by the MV Act.</P></DIR>

They further highlight Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules, which expressly permits the STA to delegate its power to grant a permit other than a stage carriage permit to the Chairman, Secretary, or any officer not below the rank of a Regional Transport Officer.

They argued that the power to delegate, as provided in Section 68(5) of the MV Act, was meant to ensure administrative efficiency in routine matters like the issuance of contract carriage permits. They maintained that the legislative intent was not to require that every decision be taken by a full, multi-member board but rather to facilitate expeditious processing of permit applications in cases that do not involve the complex considerations inherent in stage carriage permits.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 7.3.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> <B>Practical Necessity and Administrative Efficiency</B>: The Appellants argued that in practice, the STA is inundated with diverse functions and that delegating routine permit issuance to the Secretary, a high-ranking officer with substantial expertise in transport matters, ensures timely and efficient service.

In one instance, the learned Single Judge held that the grant of permits is quasi-judicial and cannot be delegated, while in another, it recognized that delegation is permissible if rules are framed under Section 96 of the MV Act. The Appellants argued that the latter view reflects the true statutory scheme.

Since the parent 1976 Act was enacted under Entry 42 and with Presidential assent, its repeal or amendment should likewise be affected under the same constitutional basis.

The relevant provisions of the MV Act, particularly Sections 68, 69, and 74, together with Rule 56 of the KMV Rules clearly indicate that the power to issue such permits is intended to be exercised by a multi-member body and not by a single officer.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 8.6.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> <B>Inadmissibility of Delegation to a Single Officer:</B> It is submitted that delegation of the permit-granting power to the Secretary (or any prescribed officer) is contrary to the statutory scheme. Such a delegation would effectively replace the collective decision-making process with the unilateral discretion of a single official, thereby defeating the purpose of the quasijudicial function entrusted to the STA/RTA. The learned Senior Counsel emphasizes that the legislative mandate, as enshrined in Section 68(2) of the MV Act, requires that the STA be comprised of a Chairman (with judicial or appellate experience) and not more than three other members.

The KCCA Act was designed to bring privately operated contract carriages under state control in order to serve the public interest and to implement the Directive Principles of State Policy, notably under Article 39(b) and (c). However, over the ensuing decades, the transport landscape in Karnataka underwent significant changes-urbanization intensified, public transport demand grew, and it became increasingly evident that the restrictive regime established by the KCCA Act was contributing to an artificial scarcity of public transport services, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 11.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In response to these evolving circumstances, the Legislature exercised its plenary power by enacting the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Act, 2003 (hereinafter, the 2003 Repeal Act), which repealed the KCCA Act. The repeal was not an arbitrary act of legislative whim but was backed by a clear statement of objects and reasons that identified the deficiencies in the existing regulatory framework and the necessity to liberalize the transport sector. The intention was to dismantle the statutory monopoly that the KCCA Act had created for the KSRTC and to open the door for private operators to address the burgeoning public transport needs.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 12.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The Preamble to 2003 Repeal Act reads as follows:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;An Act further to amend the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 and to repeal the Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">Whereas it is expedient further to amend the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 (Karnataka Act 35 of 1957) and to repeal the Karnataka Contract Carriages (Acquisition) Act, 1976 (Karnataka Act 21 of 1976) for the purposes hereinafter appearing;&quot;</P></DIR>

Those Supreme Court decisions merely affirmed the constitutional validity of the KCCA Act at the time of its enactment; they do not bind the Legislature from modifying or repealing a statute when subsequent developments warrant a change in policy. Moreover, the argument that the repeal should have required fresh presidential assent is misplaced. A repeal statute does not recreate the legal framework anew but rather extinguishes the earlier Act's operative provisions; it is not subject to the same procedural requirements as an original enactment when it comes to the need for fresh assent, provided that the repeal falls within the legislative competence of the State.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 14.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Furthermore, the 2003 Repeal Act is rooted in the practical realities of modern transport policy. Contemporary challenges, such as increasing demand for public transport services, congestion in urban areas, and the need for efficient service delivery, necessitated a more flexible regulatory regime. The legislative history and the Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the 2003 Repeal Act make it clear that the Legislature intended to remedy the inefficiencies of the past by introducing competition into the transport sector. The repeal of the KCCA Act was thus a deliberate policy decision aimed at fostering a more dynamic and responsive transport framework rather than an attempt to nullify well-established judicial pronouncements.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Additionally, it has been held on various instances by this Court that a Legislature may, subject to constitutional limitations, repeal any law it has enacted. In <B>Ramakrishna vs. Janpad Sabha[14]</B></FONT>, it has been emphatically held that if the Legislature has the power to enact a law on a particular subject, it equally possesses the power to repeal that law. The relevant paras of this judgement have been reproduced hereunder:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;13. It must however be observed that merely because the legislature is empowered under this entry to constitute local authorities and vest them with powers and jurisdiction it would not follow that these local bodies could be vested with authority to levy any and every tax for the purpose of raising revenue for the purposes of local administration. They could be validly authorised to raise only those taxes which the province could raise under and by virtue of the relevant entries in the Provincial Legislative List. This is on the principle that the province could not authorise local bodies created by it to impose taxes which it itself could not directly levy for the purposes of the Provincial Government. Now comes the question whether the Provincial Legislature was competent, by legislation, to discontinue the levy of the tax by effecting a repeal of the taxing provision contained in the Local Self Government Act of 1920. There is no doubt that the general principle is that the power of a legislative body to repeal a law is co extensive with its power to enact such law, as would be seen from the following passage in the judgment by Lord Watson in <B>Attorney-General for Ontario vs. Attorney-General for the Dominion [(1896) AC 348</B> at p. 366] :</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;Neither the Parliament of Canada nor the Provincial Legislatures have authority to repeal statutes which they could not directly enact.&quot;</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">But obviously it application in particular instances would be controlled by express constitutional provision modifying the same. We have such a provision in the case on hand in Section 143(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935. In the context the relevant words of the subsection could only mean &quot;may continue to be levied if so desired by the Provincial Legislature&quot; which is indicated by or is implicit in the use of the expression &quot;may&quot; in the clause &quot;may be continued until provision to the contrary is made by the Federal Legislature&quot;. This would therefore posit a limited legislative power in the province to indicate or express a desire to continue or not to continue the levy. If in the exercise of this limited power the province desires to discontinue the tax and effects a repeal of the relevant statute the repeal would be effective. Of course in the absence of legislation indicating a desire to discontinue the tax, the effect of the provision of the Constitution would be to enable the continuance of the power to levy the tax but this does not alter the fact that the provision by its implication confers a limited legislative power to desire or not to desire the continuance of the levy subject to the overriding power of the Central Legislature to put an end to its continuance and it is on the basis of the existence of this limited legislative power that the right of the Provincial Legislature to repeal the taxation provision under the Act of 1920 could be rested. Suppose for instance, a Provincial Legislature desires the continuance of the tax but considers the rate too high and wishes it to be reduced and passes an enactment for that purpose, it cannot be that the legislation is incompetent and that the State Government must permit the local authority to levy tax at the same rate as prevailed on 1-4-1937, if the latter desired the continuance of the tax. If such a legislation were enacted to achieve a reduction of the rate of the duty, &quot;its legislative competence must obviously be traceable to the power contained in the words&quot; may continue to be levied in Section 143(2) of the Government of India Act. If we are right so far it would follow that in the exercise of this limited legislative power the Provincial Legislature would also have a right to legislate for the continuance of the tax provided, if of course, the other conditions of Section 143(2) are satisfied viz. (1) that the tax was one which was lawfully levied by a local authority for the purposes of a local area at the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act, (2) that the identity of the body that collects the tax, the area for whose benefit the tax is to be utilised and the purposes for which the utilisation is to take place continue to be the same, and (3) the rate of the tax is not enhanced nor its incidence in any manner altered, so that it continues to be same tax. If as we have held earlier there is a limited legislative power in the province to enact a law with reference to the tax levy so as to continue it, the validity of the Act of 1949 which manifested the legislative intent to continue the tax without any break the legal continuity being established by the retrospective operation of the provision, has to be upheld.&quot;</P> <B><p style="Text-align : justify">[14]</B> AIR 1962 SC 1073</P></DIR>

The legislative intent, as clearly articulated in the 2003 Repeal Act, was to improve public transport services and to rectify the shortcomings of the earlier regulatory regime. Accordingly, we hold that Section 3 of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles Taxation and Certain Other Law (Amendment) Act, 2003, which repeals the KCCA Act, is constitutional.

  <p style="Text-align : justify"> This provision unambiguously confers upon the STA and RTA the power to delegate its functions provided that rules are framed under Section 96 of the Act. In the present context, the delegation in question concerns the grant of permits that are not stage carriage permits. This is further clarified in Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules, which reads as follows:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">"56.

   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 21.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The language of Rule 56(1)(d) explicitly differentiates between the grant of stage carriage permits, which involve complex and inherently quasijudicial considerations, and other types of permits that are essentially administrative in nature. The fact that only the grant of stage carriage permits is excluded from delegation underscores the Legislature's intention: routine and time-sensitive permits such as contract carriage, special, tourist, and temporary permits can be efficiently processed through delegation to a competent officer like the Secretary, thereby ensuring that administrative functions are not unduly delayed by the need for a full board's involvement.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 22.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The Respondents argue that permit-granting is a quasi-judicial function that must be exercised solely by the composite body of the STA or RTA, as such functions require deliberation by multiple high-ranking officials, ensuring that decisions are made with due consideration and dissenting opinions.

However, this argument does not withstand if we have a closer analysis of the statutory provisions.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 23.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Firstly, even if one accepts that the grant of permits has a quasi-judicial element, it is an established principle of administrative law that quasi-judicial functions may be delegated if the enabling statute expressly provides for such delegation. Here, Section 68(5) of the MV Act, coupled with the specific language of Rule 56(1)(d) of the KMV Rules makes it clear that the Legislature intended for the STA to delegate certain routine permit functions. The exclusion of stage carriage permits from this delegation does not imply that all permit functions are inherently non-delegable; rather, it reflects a calibrated approach that distinguishes between complex adjudicatory functions and routine administrative tasks.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 24.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Secondly, from a practical standpoint, the STA is entrusted with a wide range of responsibilities under the Motor Vehicles Act, and its workload necessitates delegation to ensure timely service delivery. The Secretary, being a high-ranking officer with substantial expertise in transport administration, is well equipped to handle routine permit applications. The delegation mechanism is not a blank check for arbitrary decision-making; it operates within the boundaries and conditions prescribed by the enabling rules framed under Section 96 of the MV Act. This ensures that, while administrative efficiency is achieved, there remains adequate oversight and accountability through the broader STA framework.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 25.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Moreover, the High Court's reasoning in this regard appears to have conflated the inherent quasijudicial nature of certain decisions with the broader statutory power of delegation. The High Court held that because permit-granting is quasi-judicial, it cannot be delegated to a single officer. However, this view fails to recognize that delegation does not remove judicial oversight from the process. Instead, it merely streamlines routine functions that do not require the full deliberative process of the STA. In <B>Newtech Promoters &amp; Developers (P) Ltd. vs. State of U.P.[15]</B></FONT>, this Court has affirmed that even quasijudicial functions may be delegated if the statute provides for it and if appropriate safeguards are in place.

It is a well-established principle of interpretation of law that the court should read the section in literal sense and cannot rewrite it to suit its convenience; nor does any canon of construction permit the court to read the section in such a manner as to render it to some extent otiose. Section 81 of the Act positively empowers the Authority to delegate such of its powers and functions to any member by a general or a special order with an exception to make regulations under Section 85 of the Act. As a consequence, except the power to make regulations under Section 85 of the Act, other powers and functions of the Authority, by a general or special order, if delegated to a Single Member of the Authority is indeed within the fold of Section 81 of the Act.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">115. The further submission made by the learned counsel for the promoters that Section 81 of the Act empowers even delegation to any officer of the Authority or any other person, it is true that the Authority, by general or special order, can delegate any of its powers and functions to be exercised by any member or officer of the Authority or any other person but we are not examining the delegation of power to any third party. To be more specific, this Court is examining the limited question as to whether the power under Section 81 of the Act can be delegated by the Authority to any of its member to decide the complaint under Section 31 of the Act. What has been urged by the learned counsel for the promoters is hypothetical which does not arise in the facts of the case. If the delegation is made at any point of time which is in contravention to the scheme of the Act or is not going to serve the purpose and object with which power to delegate has been mandated under Section 81 of the Act, it is always open for judicial review.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">116. The further submission made by the learned counsel for the appellants that Section 81 of the Act permits the Authority to delegate such powers and functions to any member of the Authority which are mainly administrative or clerical, and cannot possibly encompass any of the core functions which are to be discharged by the Authority, the judicial functions are non-delegable, as these are the core functions of the Authority. The submission may not hold good for the reason that the power to be exercised by the Authority in deciding complaints under Section 31 of the Act is quasi-judicial in nature which is delegable provided there is a provision in the statute. As already observed, Section 81 of the Act empowers the Authority to delegate its power and functions to any of its members, by general or special order.&quot;</P> <B><p style="Text-align : justify">[15]</B> (2021) 18 SCC 1</P></DIR>
