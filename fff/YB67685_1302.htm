They were duly selected and appointed as Work Inspectors on 1st January, 1990 in the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes Co-operative Development Corporation against a sanctioned post.(b) That the State Government felt an imminent need for qualified engineers to carry out the Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project (CERP) in the year 1990. The Panchayat Raj Department issued G.O.M. No. 540, dated 30th August, 1990, sanctioning another 386 posts of AEEs under the CERP. At that point in time, no rules were in place for the appointment of Engineers in the Panchayat Raj Department. To meet the exigency, the appellants and one other who were already serving as Works Inspectors in the Cooperative Department Corporation were appointed as temporary AEEs under Rule 10(a)(i)(1) of Andhra Pradesh State and Subordinate Service Rules vide order dated 5th December, 1992. Their appointment was in no manner de hors the rules or a backdoor appointment.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(c) That no challenge was ever laid by the private respondents to the G.O.M. No. 234 dated 27th June, 2005, vide which the services of the appellants and other similarly situated candidates were regularized and thus, the same has attained finality. He urged that the services of the appellants and the similarly situated candidates could not be regularized at an earlier point in time due to the need for amendment of the Andhra Pradesh Panchayati Raj and Rural Development Act/Rules and for the creation of a channel for the absorption of the appellants and similarly placed persons. He urged that the delay in amending the aforesaid rules cannot be attributed to the appellants and they cannot be put to a disadvantage for this reason by placing them below the last regularly appointed employee selected after the promulgation of the Act of 1994.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(d) That the appellants and the other similarly situated candidates are of the 1990-1992 batch and have continued to discharge their functions uninterruptedly for the last 31 years while securing periodic promotions. If the impugned order is not set aside, they would be placed below the regularly recruited batch of 1997(private respondents herein) and thereby, they would lose 7 years of seniority. He further stated the appellants are due to retire in January, 2026 and they will superannuate without receiving the promotion to which they are rightfully entitled.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(e) The learned counsel tried to draw a clear distinction between the G.O.M. No. 540, dated 30th August, 1990, vide which the sanctioned posts under CERP were created and the appellants were appointed as AEEs, and the G.O.M. No. 1289, dated 10th August, 1994. He urged that G.O.M. No. 1289, which permitted the department to fill up the further project-based vacancies to the posts of AEEs, contained an express stipulation that the candidates were being appointed temporarily, subject to the condition that they should seek selection by APPSC, failing which, they would be reverted as Work Inspectors, whereas, no such condition existed in G.O.M. No. 540 dated 30th August, 1990.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(f) That though the terms of appointment would show that the appointment of the appellants and the similarly situated candidates was temporary, however, it was neither limited by time, nor was it meant to be a stop-gap/ad hoc arrangement. He drew the Court's attention to the G.O.M. No. 391, dated 30th June, 1994, which dealt with Jawahar Rozgar Yojana Scheme and urged that this G.O.M. contained a clause providing that as and when the Cyclone Emergency Reconstruction Project/Circles/Divisions are abolished, the persons working in these Circles/Divisions/Sub-Divisions shall be posted in newly sanctioned Circles and Divisions. The posts that were sanctioned for the CERP in the office of the Chief Engineer, CERP would stand abolished w.e.f. 30th June, 1994, but the staff would continue to attend the residual work till the work is completed. He urged that there was a clear intent on the part of the State Government while issuing this G.O.M. that the persons working in the Sub-divisions created under the CERP would be posted to new Circles/Divisions/Sub-Divisions under the Panchayat Raj Department and thus, for all practical purposes, the services of the appellants and his peers who were appointed as AEEs under the CERP were to be absorbed into the cadre of Panchayat Raj Department upon the completion of the project.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(g) That the State Government had filed a counter affidavit in the writ petitions<B>[18]</B></FONT> filed before the Division Bench by the regularly appointed 1997 batch recruits(private respondents herein) challenging the G.O.M.

No. 262, dated 17th June, 2006. He submitted that the doctrine of 'functus officio' is not applicable to administrative decisions based on policy considerations and if such doctrine is made applicable to the rulemaking power of the Government, the administrative setup would be virtually crippled.

On the other hand, the appellants and other similarly situated candidates were appointed as AEEs purely on a temporary basis during 1990-1995, either on promotion, on recruitment by transfer or were sponsored by the employment exchange.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(b) That the appellants and other similarly situated employees were neither appointed with due adherence to any selection procedure nor was their appointment made in accordance with any service rules. He urged that the appellants were not even borne in the cadre as on the date on which the respondents were regularly selected as AEEs in the Panchayat Raj Department and thus, the respondents who were directly recruited through APPSC are entitled to be placed above the appellants and other similarly situated temporary AEEs in the order of seniority.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(c) That the APPSC published Notification No. 4 of 1990 calling for applications from all persons aspiring to be appointed as AEEs on a regular basis. Further, a second opportunity was given vide another Notification No. 8 of 1995 calling for applications for regular selection on the post of AEEs. He thus urged that sufficient opportunities were given to the appellants and similarly situated persons to get appointed via the direct recruitment process conducted by the APPSC, but they did not avail of the same.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(d) That vide G.O.M. No. 234, dated 27th June, 2005, a final decision was taken and the services of the appellants and other similarly situated employees were regularized. However, they were rightly directed to be placed below the last regularly selected candidate appointed through APPSC. He submitted that this G.O.M. was a final policy decision taken by the State Government, since it was issued after duly taking into consideration the recommendations of the Cabinet Sub-Committee and the General Administration Department and also the fact that the appellants and other similarly situated candidates had rendered more than 10 years of uninterrupted service and were working against the sanctioned posts.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(e) The learned senior counsel appearing for the private respondents fairly submitted that the decision to regularise the services of the appellants and other similarly situated candidates was justified. He, however, urged that once a final decision had been taken and orders were passed with respect to seniority vide G.O.M. No. 234, the State Government became functus officio and could not have re-examined and re-opened the issue of seniority on the basis of representation made by the affected parties.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(f) That vide the revised G.O.M. No. 262, dated 17th June, 2006, one set of the employees who were appointed between 1990 and 1992(including the appellants herein) were placed above the respondents in the seniority list. He urged that the revised G.O.M. was issued without affording an opportunity of hearing to the respondents herein as no notice was given to them before taking a decision adversely affecting their seniority, which is in utter violation of principles of natural justice and thus, the same was rightly struck down by the Division Bench.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(g) That the factors forming the basis for the issuance of the revised G.O.M. No. 262 were evidently within the knowledge of the State Government at the time of issuing the earlier G.O.M. No. 234. However, no sufficient explanation has been offered by the State Government as to why these critical considerations were overlooked during the formulation of the earlier G.O.M., thereby necessitating the subsequent revision.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">(h) That the instant case falls under the corollary drawn to Proposition(A) enumerated by the Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of <B>Direct Recruit Class II Engg. Officers' Association</B> (supra), which lays down that &quot;where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stop-gap arrangement, the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for considering the seniority.&quot; He urged that the initial appointment of the appellants and the similarly situated persons to the post of AEEs was ad-hoc and not according to the rules prevailing in the Panchayat Raj Department, and thus, the period of temporary service (i.e. from 1990 to 2005) rendered by the appellants prior to their regularisation cannot be counted for determining the seniority.</P></DIR>

The appellants and one similarly placed candidate were transferred from the Corporation and came to be appointed as Assistant Executive Engineers (AEEs) on a temporary basis in the said project vide order dated 5th December, 1992. The relevant portion of the appointment order is extracted below: -</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;1.

The appointment referred to in para (1) above is purely temporary and does not confer any right for regular appointment or otherwise liable to be terminated at any time without prior notice or intimation and without assigning any reasons therefore, since the project is temporary.&quot;</P></DIR>
  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Thus, it is clear that a specific reference was given while taking the decision for these temporary appointments, that the said appointments were being made under Rule 10(a)(i) of the General Rules for State and Subordinate services i.e., Andhra Pradesh Subordinate Service Rules. In this background, there is no dispute that the appellants were appointed as AEEs against the regularly sanctioned posts albeit on a temporary basis.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> (iii) The private respondents were appointed as AEEs in 1997, after undergoing the regular selection process through APPSC in accordance with the Act of 1994.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> (iv) The appellants and similarly situated employees continued to serve as AEEs in the Panchayat Raj Department for almost 13 years before their prayer for regularisation was favourably considered by the State Government vide G.O.M. No. 234, dated 27th June, 2005. However, this G.O.M contained a stipulation that the services of all temporary AEEs (including the appellants herein) appointed between 1990-1995 would be placed below the last regularly selected candidate of AEEs in terms of seniority. This G.O.M. further directed that all the temporary appointments made between 1990-1995 and continuing on that date, shall be excluded from the purview of APPSC under the proviso to clause 3 of Article 320 of the Constitution of India. Aggrieved by the denial of seniority and being placed below the private respondents, the appellants and others filed various representations to the State Government contending that the AEEs appointed during 19901992, i.e., before the promulgation of the Act of 1994, and those appointed between 1993-1995, i.e., after the enactment of the Act, should not be treated at par. They asserted that these groups were in different legal classes and could not be merged as directed in G.O.M. No. 234. Additionally, they claimed that significant injustice had been done to the AEEs appointed between 19901992, who were made junior to AEEs appointed in 1997, thus losing nearly 10-15 years of continuous service. As a result, they would retire without the chance of receiving even a single promotion during their entire service tenure.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> (v) These representations were considered and accepted by the State Government, leading to partial modification of the earlier G.O.M No. 234 and issuance of a revised G.O.M No. 262, dated 17th June, 2006, wherein the State Government introduced a classification amongst temporarily appointed AEEs based on their dates of appointment with reference to the promulgation of Act of 1994. The classification divided the AEEs into two groups: those appointed between 1990-1992 and those appointed between 19931995. The revised G.O.M. further stipulated that the temporary AEEs appointed between 1990-1992 would be placed below the last regular AEE appointed through the APPSC, prior to the enactment of the Act of 1994.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> (vi) The reason assigned by the State Government for this modification and sub-classification (i.e. one group of AEEs appointed between 1990-1992 and the other between 1993-1995), was that the temporary AEEs in the first group had put in 10 years of interrupted service including the services in the feeder cadre of Work Inspector/Draftsmen/Tracer before their appointment as temporary AEEs. The significant delay in considering their prayer for regularisation in the Panchayat Raj Department was attributable to the fact that the Government could not amend the service rules as per G.O.M. No. 429, dated 6th March, 1990, to take up the regularisation of the temporary AEEs. Therefore, one of the crucial factors in the decision to issue the revised G.O.M. No. 262 was the Government's inaction in amending the service rules, as required by G.O.M. No. 429.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> (vii) The decision to regularize the services of the appellants and other similarly situated candidates, appointed as temporary AEEs between 1990 and 1995, taken by the State Government vide G.O.M.

No. 1289 dated 10th August, 1994, both issued by the Panchayat Raj Department. A careful comparison of the two G.O.M's highlight a significant difference in their terms and conditions. G.O.M. No. 540, which created the sanctioned posts for AEEs under CERP, did not include any clause making the appointments conditional upon selection by the APPSC. There was no provision for reversion to a lower position if the appointees were not selected through a regular selection process conducted by the APPSC. On the other hand, G.O.M. No. 1289, issued on 10th August, 1994, explicitly provided that the appointments were temporary and subjected the appointees to the rigor of selection through the APPSC or else face reversion. It stipulated that the candidates who were not selected through APPSC, they would be reverted to the position of Work Inspectors. This clause made it clear that the appointments under G.O.M. No. 1289 were temporary and contingent upon selection through the APPSC, a stipulation that was notably missing in G.O.M. No. 540. The absence of such a condition in G.O.M.

The appellant did not challenge the validity of Rule 47 and no mala fides were established against the authorities in exercise of powers of relaxation under the said Rule. The Tribunal has recorded a finding that the Rule relating to the method of recruitment was not relaxed but only the conditions which had to be fulfilled for the purpose of promotion to the category of Sub-Inspector were relaxed; this finding is not disturbed by the High Court; there was no relaxation as to the basic qualification; the State Government regularised the services of the respondent and others with retrospective effect from the date they were temporarily appointed as Sub-Inspectors (OSSIs). <B>It is also not disputed that they continued in service uninterruptedly for about 12-13 years till their services were regularised with retrospective effect.

The relevant extract from the said judgment is as follows:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;113. Turning to the present case, the appellants' argument that the Union Government was rendered functus officio after establishing the OAT does not stand scrutiny. The decision to establish the OAT was administrative and based on policy considerations<B>. If the doctrine of functus officio were to be applied to the sphere of administrative decision-making by the state, its executive power would be crippled. The state would find itself unable to change or reverse any policy or policy-based decision and its functioning would grind to a halt. All policies would attain finality and any change would be close to impossible to effectuate</B>.</P><B><p style="Text-align : justify">114. This would impact not only major policy decisions but also minor ones</B>. For example, a minor policy decision such as a bus route would not be amenable to any modification once it was notified. Once determined, the bus route would stay the same regardless of the demand for, say, an additional stop at a popular destination. Major policy decisions such as those concerning subsidies, corporate governance, housing, education, and social welfare would be frozen if the doctrine of functus officio were to be applied to administrative decisions.</P><B><p style="Text-align : justify">This is not conceivable because it would defeat the purpose of having a government and the foundation of governance. By their very nature, policies are subject to change depending on the circumstances prevailing in society at any given time. The doctrine of functus officio cannot ordinarily be applied in cases where the government is formulating and implementing a policy.&quot;</B> (emphasis supplied)</P></DIR>

If the State Government is compelled to afford an opportunity of hearing to every individual or entity likely to be affected by its administrative decision-making, it would effectively paralyze governance by imposing an undue procedural roadblock.
