Issues</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 15.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> As previously elaborated, the singular issue prompting filing of the instant Application is to determine definitively whether the judgment in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) is applicable prospectively or extends retrospectively.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> D. Analysis</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 16.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> At the outset, it is essential to briefly refer to the ratio espoused in <B>Tarsem singh</B> (supra), which, after considering the relevant facts, applicable laws, and precedents, held that Section 3J of the NHAI Act, by excluding the applicability of the 1894 Act and thereby denying solatium and interest for lands acquired under the NHAI Act, is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. To this end, the decision in <B>Tarsem singh</B> (supra) took notice of the eleven grounds raised on behalf of the NHAI and the Union of India, and dealt with those grounds by segregating the appeals therein into eleven groups and outlining them in seriatim.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 17.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Regardless, the prayer in the instant Application expressly seeks clarification that the decision in <B>Tarsem singh</B> (supra) should be deemed to operate prospectively only. However, in our considered view, granting such a clarification would effectively nullify the very relief that <B>Tarsem singh</B> (supra) intended to provide, as the prospective operation of it would restore the state of affairs to the same position as it was before the decision was rendered.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 18.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> We say so for the reason that the broader purpose behind <B>Tarsem singh</B> (supra) was to resolve and put quietus upon the quagmire created by Section 3J of the NHAI Act, which led to the unequal treatment of similarly situated individuals. The impact of Section 3J was short-lived, owing to the applicability of the 2013 Act upon the NHAI Act from the date of 01.01.2015. As a result, two classes of landowners emerged, devoid of any intelligible differentia: those whose lands were acquired by the NHAI between 1997 and 2015, and those whose lands were acquired otherwise.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 19.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> This must be viewed in the light of the principle that when a provision is declared unconstitutional, any continued disparity strikes at the core of Article 14 and must be rectified, particularly when such disparity affects only a select group. To illustrate, rendering the decision in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) as prospective would create a situation where a landowner whose land was acquired on 31.12.2014 would be denied the benefit of solatium and interest, whereas a landowner whose land was acquired the very next day, 01.01.2015the date on which the Ordinance was promulgated, to read the 2013 Act into the NHAI Act, would be entitled to these statutory benefits.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 20.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Be that as it may, even if we were to assume that the decision in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) suffers from the vice of vagueness, the absence of a judicial directive or an explicit legislative mandate should not result in the creation of an artificial classification among a homogeneous group by the same State exercising powers under the same Statute. In this specific instance, the landowners have no discretion or choice regarding the date of land acquisition or the surrender of possession. Thus, both equity and equality demand that no such discrimination be permitted, as allowing it would be unjust.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 21.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> That being so, the decision in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) also cannot be assailed on the grounds that it opens a Pandoras Box or contravenes the doctrine of immutability, as it merely allows for the grant of solatium or interest, which are inherently embedded as compensatory benefits under an expropriating legislation. This exercise cannot be equated to reopening of cases or revisiting the decisions that have already attained finality. Similarly, the restoration of these twin benefits does not invite reconsideration of the merits of a decided case, re-evaluation of the compensation amount, or potentially declaring the acquisition process itself to be unlawful. Instead, the ultimate outcome of <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) is limited to granting solatium and interest to aggrieved landowners whose lands were acquired by NHAI between 1997 and 2015. It does not, in any manner, direct the reopening of cases that have already attained finality.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 22.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> On the contrary, modifying or clarifying the judgment in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) would lend itself to violating the doctrine of immutability, undermining the finality of the decision. In fact, what the Applicant seeks to achieve, indirectly, is to evade responsibility and further delay the resolution of a settled issue where the directions given are unequivocalQuando aliquid prohibetur ex directo, prohibetur et per obliquum i.e. what cannot be done directly should also not be done indirectly. This Court has, on several occasions, disapproved of the practice of filing Miscellaneous Applications as a strategic litigation tactic aimed at neutralising judicial decisions and seeking a second opportunity for relief.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 23.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In all fairness, the only defense that may perhaps seem appealing is the claim of a financial burden amounting to Rupees 100 crores. However, this argument does not persuade us for several reasons: First, if this burden has been borne by the NHAI in the case of thousands of other landowners, it stands to reason that it should also be shared by the NHAI in this instance, in order to eliminate discrimination. Second, the financial burden of acquiring land cannot be justified in the light of the Constitutional mandate of Article 300A. Third, since most National Highways are being developed under the Public Private Partnership model, the financial burden will ultimately be passed on to the relevant Project Proponent. Fourth, even the Project Proponent would not have to bear the compensation costs out of pocket, as it is the commuters who will bear the actual brunt of this cost. Ultimately, the burden is likely to be saddled onto the middle or upper-middle-class segment of society, particularly those who can afford private vehicles or operate commercial ventures. We are thus not inclined to entertain the plea for prospectivity on this limited tenet.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 24.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Lastly, as regards the decision in <B>Sunita Mehra</B> (supra), which is claimed to have prohibited the grant of solatium or interest in concluded cases, we find that this position has already been addressed and clarified in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra). Given that the Government, through the then Solicitor General, had conceded this issue at that time, it cannot now retract its stance and seek to reargue the same bone of contention. Hence, this assertion too, stands rejected.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> E. Conclusion</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 25.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In view of the foregoing analysis, we find no merit in the contentions raised by the Applicant, NHAI. We reaffirm the principles established in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra) regarding the beneficial nature of granting solatium and interest while emphasising the need to avoid creating unjust classifications lacking intelligible differentia. Consequently, we deem it appropriate to dismiss the present Miscellaneous Application.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 26.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Leave is granted in the other connected matters, and all the appeals are disposed of with a direction to the Competent Authority to calculate the amount of solatium and interest in accordance with the directions issued in <B>Tarsem Singh</B> (supra). In this context, the appeal arising out of SLP (C) Diary No. 52538/2023 is dismissed, as the challenge therein pertains to the High Courts refusal to award Additional Market Value as another component of the compensation, while solatium and interest have already been granted.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 27.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of in the above terms.
