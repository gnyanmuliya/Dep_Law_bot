In view of the above discussion, we decide the question No. (i) in favour of the State and against the Shebait/Pujari claiming the land to be saved by the Jagirs Act of 1952. The land held in Jagir by Hindu idol (deity) as Dolidar or Muafidar cultivated by a person other than the Shebait/Pujari of the deity personally or by hired labour or servants engaged by its Shebait/Pujari as a tenant of the deity, shall vest in the State, after the Jagirs Act of 1952. The Hindu idol (deity), even if it is treated to be a perpetual minor, could not continue to hold such land. Such land cannot be treated to be in its personal cultivation. A tenant of such land cultivating the land acquired the rights of khatedar of the State. Such land under the tenancy of a person other than Shebait/Pujari of Hindu Idol (deity) became khatedari land of such tenant. The name of Hindu Idol (deity) from such land had to be expunged from the revenue records with Shebait/Pujuri having no right to claim the land as Khatedar. Consequently, they had no right to transfer such lands, and all such transfers have to be treated as null and void, in contravention of the Jagirs Act 1952, and the land under such transfers to be resumed by the State. </P> <p style="Text-align : justify">Question (ii).

The Hindu Idol (deity) in the lands held by them in the name of its Shebait/Pujari on the date of resumption of such Jagir under the provisions of the Jagirs Act of 1952 did not have any rights except in khudkasht land cultivated by Shebait/Pujari either by themselves or by hired labour or servant engaged by them for the benefit of the expenses of the temple including sewa puja.

Even if the fraud is alleged, the power must not be exercised after unreasonable period, such as, after several decades claiming rights over the land.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 12.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Counsel further relied upon the Division Bench Judgment of this court in the matter of <B>Anandi Lal v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. reported in 1996 (2) WLC 36 </B>where in paras-23 &amp; 28 it has been held as under:-</P> <DIR> <p style="Text-align : justify">23. The contention that the land was a Muafi Murti Mandir Land, therefore, the power could be exercised after any length of time, cannot be accepted. The question is not with regard to the nature of the land. The question which is required to be examined is as to whether the revisional power conferred upon the authority concerned under the provisions of Section 82 of the Act of 1956 and under the provisions of Section 232 of the Act of 1955, could be exercised after unreasonable period of time. As held by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions, the power could be exercised within reasonable time whenever the statute does not provide for the period of limitation. What would be the reasonable period, would depend upon the facts of the case and the nature of the order sought to be revised.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">28. In our opinion, in this case there is no material, whatsoever, to indicate that the exercise of power after a period of about 25 years is in any way justified. Thus, the order of reference made by the Additional Collector, Baran and the power exercised by the Board of Revenue, being unreasonable, unjust and unfair, the decision rendered by them in exercise of such powers, cannot be sustained in law. In facts of the case, we do not think it proper that it is just and proper to remit the matter to Board of Revenue and permit the State to exercise its power after such an inordinate delay. For these reasons the judgment and order passed by the Board of Revenue is required to be quashed and set aside and the order passed by the Assistant Collector, Baran in Revenue Case No. 50/1956 decided on October 12, 1957, is required to be restored.</P></DIR> </DIR>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 13.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Counsel further submits that earlier the respondents approached this court by filing S.B. Civil Writ Petition No.14863/2016 (Gulab Bewa Nanga &amp; Ors. v. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.) with the prayer to pass an order for making compliance of the order passed by the Board of Revenue, the said writ petition was decided on 25.10.2016 and it has been held as under:-</P> <DIR> <p style="Text-align : justify">"This petition has been filed by the petitioners with the grievance that petitioners along with performa respondents are khatedar of land Khasra No. 208, 209, 210, 211/12, 213 and 211/843 total area 10.13 bigha situated at village Bambori, Patwar Halka Machwa, tehsil &amp; District Jaipur. In the year of 1952, the Rajasthan resumption of Jagir Act came in to force and thereafter the Jagir of Jagirdar/Mafidar were resumed and after resumption of Jagir, the ancestral of petitioners were become khatedar tenant of aforesaid land in question and since then petitioners along with the performa respondents are khatedar tenant of the aforesaid land in question. The respondent-Tehsildar made a reference in the year of 2005 to District Collector Jaipur pleading therein that land in question belongs to the land of mandir muafi and in the revenue record the name of the tenants was wrongly mentioned. On the basis of the recommendation made by the Tehsildar, the District Collector registered a case no.51/2005 and vide its order dated 09.01.2006 made the reference to Board of Revenue. The Board of Revenue vide its order dated 21.07.2015 has dismissed the reference made by the District Collector, Jaipur. The aforesaid order was passed by the Board of Revenue in presence of the both the parties. In spite of that petitioners along with other co-tenant had submitted a certified copy of the aforesaid order to respondent, but still respondents did not make compliance of the aforesaid order of Board of Revenue. It is contended that the Government of Rajasthan vide its notification dated 24.05.2007 has settled the controversy. According to aforesaid circular the reference made by the Collector is not maintainable and while considering the aforesaid Circular, the Board of Revenue dismissed the reference made by the district collector Jaipur.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">It is contended Larger Bench of this Court also decided the controversy on 15.07.2015 which is reported in RRD 2015 page 556 in case of Tara &amp; 35 ors. v.

Thus the act of respondent is against the principal of natural justice as well as violation of Circular dated 24.05.2007.
