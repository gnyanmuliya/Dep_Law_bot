Thereafter, a fresh select list consisting of 249 candidates including the names of appellants (and four others) was published on 16.9.1998 and the appointment order was issued on 17.9.1998. The selection and appointment of the appellants was challenged by an unsuccessful candidate-Archana Mishra (Respondent No. 4 herein), before the Collector, District Chatarpur, Madhya Pradesh, under Section 3 of Madhya Pradesh Panchayat (Appeal and Revision) Rules, 1995 (for short &quot;Appeal and Revision Rules,1995) alleging that elements of nepotism, corruption and bias have seeped into the selection process because of the composition of the selection committee. The Collector, accepting the challenger's contention vide order dated 02.06.1999, set aside the appellants' appointment by concluding that the recruitment was vitiated on account of bias and nepotism. The Collector found fault with the composition of the selection committee, some of whom were the family members of the appellants herein and opined that the award of marks in the selection, was improper. Relying on Section 40 (c) and Section 100 of Panchayat Raj Act Avam Gram Swaraj Adhiniyam, 1993 (for short &quot;Adhiniyam, 1993), it was noted that office bearers cannot facilitate financial gains to relatives.

The selectees contended therein that without arraying them and without affording them any hearing, the Collector could not have interfered with the selection and this would be in violation of the principles of natural justice. The Revision Petition was however dismissed by the Commissioner vide order dated 14.3.2000. In the said order the Commissioner observed in para (6) that the selection is contrary to Section 40 (C) of the Adhiniyam, 1993. The Revisional Authority brushed aside the plea of non-joinder and of not affording opportunity of hearing, by relying on the admission of the relationship of the appellants with the members of the selection committee, as noted in the reply filed by the Chief Executive Officer. Aggrieved by the order of the Commissioner, the appointees filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India before the Madhya Pradesh High Court which was however dismissed by the learned single judge vide order dated 31.7.2008.

It was also noted that full opportunity of hearing was granted at the Revisional stage by the Commissioner. According to the learned Judge the Chief Executive officer's reply established that few selectees were relatives of Smt.

It is specifically pointed out that none of the relatives of the candidates had participated during the selection of the appellants. More importantly, the related persons had not awarded any marks to influence the selection.

According to them, the presence of close relatives in the selection process vitiated the process of selection of Shiksha Karmis. They projected that non-adherence to the principles of audi alteram partem, if any, was cured by the proceedings before the commissioner wherein appellants were given full opportunity. On that basis, it was submitted that the non- granting of opportunity of hearing by the Collector at the original stage was inconsequential.

It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. Whether a decision falls within this category is a question that Judges by their training and experience should be well equipped to answer, or else there would be something badly wrong with our judicial system. To justify the court's exercise of this role, resort I think is today no longer needed to Viscount Radcliffe's ingenious explanation in Edwards vs. Bairstow [<B>Edwards vs. Bairstow, 1956 AC 14 : (1955) 3 WLR 410 (HL)</B>] , of irrationality as a ground for a court's reversal of a decision by ascribing it to an inferred though unidentifiable mistake of law by the decision-maker. &quot;Irrationality&quot; by now can stand on its own feet as an accepted ground on which a decision may be attacked by judicial review.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">I have described the third head as &quot;procedural impropriety&quot; rather than failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision.

In this manner, the Panchayat addressed the concern and perception of bias in the mind of a fair-minded observer. Recusal is an acceptable mechanism and serves to eliminate any reasonable likelihood of bias. It was however argued that the counter affidavit filed by the Chief Executive Officer, Janpad Panchayat, attaching the certificate given by the Sarpanch of the Panchayat, acknowledges the relationship of the selected/appointed candidates with the members of selection committee giving rise to a reasonable conclusion of bias.

The relative of some candidate or the other is bound to find a place on the Committee. Therefore, the Court is required to see whether the prescribed balancing mechanism was followed when a relative of the member of the Selection Committee was being considered. The Rules required that when such a candidate appeared, the concerned selection committee member should recuse from the proceedings and such a candidate could only be appointed after obtaining the approval of the Regional Deputy Director, Local Government.

Secondly, natural justice principles breathe reasonableness into the procedure. Responding to the argument that the principles of natural justice are not static but are capable of being moulded to the circumstances, it was held that the core of natural justice guarantees a reasonable procedure which is a constitutional requirement entrenched in Articles 14, 19 and 21. The facet of audi alteram partem encompasses the components of notice, contents of the notice, reports of inquiry, and materials that are available for perusal. While situational modifications are permissible, the rules of natural justice cannot be modified to suit the needs of the situation to such an extent that the core of the principle is abrogated because it is the core that infuses procedural reasonableness. The burden is on the applicant to prove that the procedure that was followed (or not followed) by the adjudicating authority, in effect, infringes upon the core of the right to a fair and reasonable hearing.

This Court has, even in cases where the selected candidates were too large, unlike in the present case, held that even while adjudicating the writ petitions at least some of the selected candidates ought to be impleaded even it is in a representative capacity. It has also been held that in service jurisprudence, if an unsuccessful candidate challenges the selection process the selected candidates ought to be impleaded. [See <B>J.S.

He approached the Appeals Council for relief against the order of the branch Committee, which conducted a full rehearing but upheld the Branch Committee's decision. The plaintiff then filed a writ, seeking declarations that his expulsion from union membership as well as his position as area organizer was unlawful, invalid, and void. Megarry J framed the question thus:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;if a man has never had a fair trial by the appropriate trial body, is it open to an appellate body to discard its appellate function and itself give the man the fair trial that he has never had?.

Even if the appeal is treated as a hearing de novo, the member is being stripped of his right to appeal to another body from the effective decision to expel him. I cannot think that natural justice is satisfied by a process whereby an unfair trial, though not resulting in a valid expulsion, will nevertheless have the effect of depriving the member of a right of appeal when a valid decision to expel him is subsequently made. Such a deprivation is a powerful result to be achieved by what in law is a mere nullity; and it is no mere triviality that might be justified on the ground that natural justice does not mean perfect justice. As a general rule, at all events, I hold that a failure of natural justice in the trial body cannot be cured by a sufficiency of natural justice in an appellate body.&quot;</P></DIR>
