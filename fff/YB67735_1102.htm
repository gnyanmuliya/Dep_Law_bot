The reason assigned were twofold: (i) mother of the respondent is in receipt of family pension of Rs. 4367.92p and hence the financial position of the family does not warrant an appointment on compassionate ground; and (ii) the respondent was overaged for the post of &quot;Prob.

Incidentally, the respondent was in excess of 26 (twenty-six) years of age and in terms of the scheme of 1993, the maximum age limit for appointment on a clerical post as well as in the sub-staff category was 26 (twenty-six) years. The scheme, however, provided for relaxation of the upper age limit up to a maximum limit of five years. For members of the scheduled caste community, ex-servicemen and physically disabled candidates, special relaxation was also provided. The respondent, though over-aged by a few months, was not considered by the appellant for such relaxation.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> e.

In furtherance of the aforesaid judgment and order, the Managing Director &amp; Chief Executive Officer<B>[10]</B></FONT> of the appellant re-examined the claim of the respondent for compassionate appointment and once again declined favourable consideration of the claim. Relevant portions from the order dated 8th September, 2015 passed by the MD &amp; CEO read as follows:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;In the particular case of Shri Ajith Kumar G K, the following facts are undisputed:</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">- The ex-employee died with a remaining service of just over 4 months only and the dependent family was eligible for full terminal benefits (gross Rs.3.23 lacs and net Rs.3.09 lacs after recovery of outstanding liabilities) and a family pension of Rs.4637.92 during 2002.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">- He had then left behind his spouse, one unmarried son.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">- The 3 daughters were married and settled.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">- The son was aged 26 years and 8 months as on the date of application.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">- The family of the deceased was drawing pension under the <B>Canara Bank</B> Pension Regulations.</P> <B><p style="Text-align : justify">[10]</B> MD &amp; CEO</P></DIR>
 </FONT> <p style="Text-align : justify"> The primary and the most basic issue to be examined therefore is whether the dependent of the deceased employee was facing any immediate financial difficulties or penury on account of the sudden death of the employee.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> In the present case, there were no minor dependent children or unmarried daughter in the family for whom future financial assistance was required. The 3 daughters of the deceased employee were already married arid settled at the time of his demise. The other deponents are his spouse and his son Sri Ajith Kumar who was then aged 26 years &amp; 8 months. The family was residing in their own house. The last drawn net salary of Sri V C Gopalakrishna Pillai as on 2001 was Rs. 9,772/- and had he survived for another 4 months he would have otherwise supported his family with the pension he would have received from the Bank (in normal course approximately Rs. 6,398/- only). After the demise of the employee, his spouse Smt Omana Amma was sanctioned with a family pension of Rs.4637.92 then and which is presently Rs.5825/- p.m. That apart Net terminal benefits to the extent of Rs.3.09 lacs (after closure of liability of Rs.13,942/-) as on 2002 which were available to dependents.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> Taking all the factors into consideration, the family circumstances prevailing then I am of the considered view that there never existed any indigent circumstances of the dependent family of Late Sri V C Gopalakrishna Pillai to say that the family was in such crisis which would not have been able to overcome without job being offered under Compassionate Appointment.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> For the reasons given above I come to the conclusion that the dependent family was not facing any acute financial distress or penury then which warrants the exercise of the discretionary powers to extend the benefit of compassionate appointment in this case.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> The question of relaxation of age arises only if the applicant is eligible for compassionate appointment. Since I have found, on the basis of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, based on which the Scheme has been framed that the applicant is not entitled for compassionate appointment. I am not considering the question of relaxation of age as per the Scheme.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> As such considering the matter in its entirety and also financial and familial conditions present then, the request, for Compassionate Appointment to the dependents of Late V C Gopalakrishna Pillai (22841), Ex-clerk, Trikkovilvattom Branch is not considered favourably.</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> The application and representation of Sri Ajith Kumar G K for compassionate appointment is therefore rejected.&quot;</P>  <p style="Text-align : justify"> n. Denial of appointment, once again, left the respondent crestfallen. He, thus, approached the High Court by presenting a writ petition<B>[11]</B></FONT> initiating the second round of litigation which has now reached this Court.

 </FONT> <p style="Text-align : justify"> The order impugned passed by the Managing Director was set aside. A direction was issued to consider the respondent for appointment under the scheme of 1993 in the sub-staff cadre within 2 (two) months.

The appellant, feeling thoroughly dissatisfied, preferred an intra-court appeal<B>[12]</B></FONT>. A Division Bench of the High Court by the impugned judgment and order dismissed the appeal with exemplary cost of Rs. 5 (five) lakh, in addition to the compensation directed to be paid by the Single Judge in the judgment and order under challenge. The Division Bench expressing astonishment at the manner in which the appellant and its officers had dealt with the claim of the respondent for compassionate appointment, directed appointment of the respondent in the sub-staff category in any of the branches of the appellant within a month.</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <B><p style="Text-align : justify">[12]</B> WA 1364/2016</P></DIR>
 </FONT> <p style="Text-align : justify"> p. The reasons for the above directions of the Division Bench are captured in paragraphs 17 and 18, reading as follows:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;17. We do not think, either of the judgments placed before us by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant-Bank commend us to cause interference to the judgment of the learned Single Judge. As noticed by the learned Single Judge, M. Mahesh Kumar and Priya Jayarajan have settled the issue under the very same Scheme of the identical Bank, which was the appellant therein. In M. Mahesh Kumar it was categorically held that grant of family pension and payment of terminal benefits cannot be treated as a substitute for providing compassionate appointment. The Hon'ble Supreme Court having held so in 2015, in the case of the very same appellant, as rightly found by the learned Single Judge, it was audacious on the part of the Bank to have passed an order in conflict with the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court by Exhibit P8 dated 08.09.2015 when the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court was already delivered on 15.05.2015. 18. Not only did the Bank pass an order in conflict with the decision in its own case, but filed an appeal from the order dismissing the writ petition. We notice that the learned Single Judge had granted Rs.5 lakhs as exemplary costs for keeping the bereaved family of the deceased, wallowing in a penurious state, that too against the very provisions of the Scheme. We also take note of the fact that the age relaxation directed to be considered in the earlier writ petition was brushed aside by the Bank. That was the relevant and only consideration which should have been made on the totality of the circumstances, especially when the son had exceeded the maximum age only by eight months. The receipt of family pension, which was found to be not a relevant consideration was also projected as a reason for denying the appointment. We reiterate that a reading of the entire Scheme, especially the special provisions enabling appointment of one dependent even if another is employed, persuades us to find the rejection of the instant claim for reason only of a family pension and retirement benefit of Rs.3.09 lakhs to be against the spirit and tenor of the Scheme.&quot;</P></DIR>
  <p style="Text-align : justify"> q. <B>Canara Bank</B> is, thus, in appeal against the said judgment and order.</P></DIR>  <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Contentions Of The Parties</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 3. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">According to learned counsel for the appellant:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">a. Reliance placed by the Single Judge and the Division Bench on paragraph 19 of the ruling in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra) was misplaced. First, because the matter at hand differs significantly from the facts and circumstances of that particular case and secondly, the contents of paragraph 19 were merely observations and do not constitute a binding precedent. The question of whether terminal benefits should be included in determining the financial status of the deceased employee's family was neither raised nor resolved in the said decision. Even otherwise, the decision in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra) has been referred to a larger bench for further consideration.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">b. Additionally, the decisions of the Single Judge and the Division Bench are inconsistent with legal principles established by this Court in a long line of decisions.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">c. In matters concerning appointment on compassionate grounds, it is essential to account for the terminal benefits as well as the family pension being provided to the family of the deceased employee while assessing the family's overall financial condition.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">d. Question of relaxation of age arises only if the applicant is otherwise eligible for compassionate appointment subject to he being found suitable for any of the two categories of posts. In the present case, it was found that the respondent was not eligible for the appointment sought on account of non-existence of indigent circumstances and hence, the question of age relaxation or testing his suitability, which are the further steps in the process, did not arise to be undertaken. The High Court, therefore, applied wrong tests to allow the claim of the respondent.</P></DIR>
   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 4. </td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify">Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent contended that:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">a. The scheme of 1993 did not contain any provision to the effect that the financial condition of the applicant's family is to be considered before giving employment on compassionate grounds. Paragraph 19 of the decision of this Court in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra) was referred to in support of the contention that it was not open to the appellant to raise the bogey of financial condition of the respondent after the death of his father did not reflect indigent circumstances. Hence, rejection of the respondent's claim solely on the ground that the family is in receipt of pension and other terminal benefits is in contravention of the decision in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra), which is binding on the appellant.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">b. The appellant's contention of the respondent being ineligible for employment on compassionate grounds on the ground of age-bar is untenable. The appellant had not raised an objection to the overage of the respondent in the letters and counter affidavits except in the letter dated 30th October, 2002 rejecting the initial application of the respondent dated 15th January, 2002. Even otherwise, the issue of overage could not have been raised later having regard to quashing of the decision contained in the letter dated 30th October, 2002 by the order of the High Court dated 16th June, 2015 having regard to the doctrine of res judicata.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">c. Moreover, the appellant had the power to relax the age and in the present case without considering such power of relaxation, the appellant rejected the application on account of receipt of terminal benefits and family pension illegally and in an arbitrary manner.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">d. That apart, there is nothing on record to suggest that the appellant made any bona fide assessment of the financial condition of the family of the deceased. It could be inferred from the submissions of the appellant that they reached the conclusion that the financial condition of the family is sound, only on the grounds that the family received the family pension and other terminal benefits without, however appreciating the ratio of the decision in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra) where receipt of terminal benefits was held to be of no consequence at all. Finally, it was submitted that substantial time has elapsed since the death of the respondent's father and that the respondent having been made to unnecessarily wait for long, the present appeal deserves dismissal with costs to the respondent.</P></DIR>

The rule of appointments to public service is that they should be on merits and through open invitation. It is the normal route through which one can get into a public employment.

As per one such exception relief is provided to the bereaved family of a deceased employee by accommodating one of his dependants in a vacancy. The object is to give succour to the family which has been suddenly plunged into penury due to the untimely death of its sole breadwinner.

It has been in excess of two decades. It does not require anyone to put on a magnifying glass here to assess the time that has been taken for the application of the respondent for compassionate appointment to be finally decided. The parties have reached the third tier in the second round. One of the foremost factors for appointment on compassionate ground is that the same should be offered at the earliest. Unless appointment is made soon after the need to mitigate hardship arises, tiding over the immediate financial crisis owing to (i) sudden premature and untimely death of the deceased employee or (ii) medical incapacitation resulting in the employee's unfitness to continue in service, - for which benevolence is shown by offering an appointment - may not exist and thereby the very object of such appointment could stand frustrated.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 26.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> More often than not, spurned claims for compassionate appointment reach the high courts or even this Court after consuming substantial time. The ordinary rule of litigation is that right to relief should be decided by reference to the date on which the suitor entered the portals of the court. The relief that the suitor is entitled in law could still be denied in equity on account of subsequent and intervening events, i.e., events between the date of commencement of the litigation and the date of the decision; however, law is well-settled that such relief may not be denied solely on account of time lost in prosecuting proceedings in judicial or quasi-judicial forum for no fault of the suitor [see : <B>Beg Raj Singh vs. State of U.P.[50]</B></FONT>].

 </FONT>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 27.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Lapse of time could, however, be a major factor for denying compassionate appointment where the claim is lodged belatedly. A presumption is legitimately drawn in cases of claims lodged belatedly that the family of the deceased/incapacitated employee is not in immediate need of financial assistance. However, what would be a reasonable time would largely depend on the policy/scheme for compassionate appointment under consideration. If any time limit has been prescribed for making an application and the claimant applies within such period, lapse of time cannot be assigned as a ground for rejection.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 28.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The death of the respondent's father, in this case, occurred in December 2001. Now, we are in 2025. The respondent cannot be blamed for the delay, since he was diligently pursuing his claim before the appellant and thereafter before the High Court. Thus, irrespective of how old the respondent is presently, his age cannot be determinative for foreclosing his claim and bar a consideration of the same on merits.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 29.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The second sub-issue pertains to the real objective sought to be achieved by offering compassionate appointment. We have noticed the objectives of the scheme of 1993 and construe such objectives as salutary for deciding any claim for compassionate appointment. The underlying idea behind compassionate appointment in death-in-harness cases appears to be that the premature and unexpected passing away of the employee, who was the only bread earner for the family, leaves the family members in such penurious condition that but for an appointment on compassionate ground, they may not survive. There cannot be a straitjacket formula applicable uniformly to all cases of employees dying-in-harness which would warrant appointment on compassionate grounds. Each case has its own peculiar features and is required to be dealt with bearing in mind the financial condition of the family. It is only in &quot;hand-to-mouth&quot; cases that a claim for compassionate appointment ought to be considered and granted, if at all other conditions are satisfied. Such &quot;hand-to-mouth&quot; cases would include cases where the family of the deceased is 'below poverty line' and struggling to pay basic expenses such as food, rent, utilities, etc., arising out of lack of any steady source of sustenance. This has to be distinguished from a mere fall in standard of life arising out of the death of the bread earner.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 30.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The observation in <B>Kunti Tiwary</B> (supra) noted above seems to assume significance and we draw inspiration therefrom in making the observation that no appointment on compassionate ground ought to be made as if it is a matter of course or right, being blissfully oblivious of the laudable object of any policy/scheme in this behalf.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 31.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Thus, examination of the financial condition to ascertain whether the respondent and his mother were left in utter financial distress because of the death of the bread earner is not something that can be loosely brushed aside.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 32.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> This takes us to the third sub-issue tasking us to consider whether there has been a proper and reasonable assessment of the financial condition of the family consequent upon death of the respondent's father. The order of the MD &amp; CEO has been extracted above, verbatim. What transpires from a bare reading of such order is that the deceased left behind him his widow, the respondent and three daughters as his surviving heirs. All the daughters were married and settled. Only his spouse and son could count as dependants. The daughters were not shown to be dependent on the deceased while he was alive and in service. The respondent and his mother were residing in their own house. That apart, the deceased was 4 (four) months away from retirement on superannuation. It has been indicated in such order what the last drawn net salary of the deceased was and had he survived even after superannuation, what quantum of money would he have received as monthly pension. Also, the amount of monthly family pension being paid to the respondent's mother is indicated. Although on behalf of the respondent a contention has been raised that there has been no proper assessment of his financial condition, rather strangely, the figures referred to by the MD &amp; CEO have not been disputed at all. We are, thus, left with no option but to proceed on the basis that the same are correct. If, indeed, the respondent's father would have received a pension amount of Rs. 6398/- and burdened to feed himself as well as his two dependants, viz. his spouse and son, the amount of family pension initially sanctioned, i.e., Rs. 4637.92 could not have, by any stretch of imagination, be seen as insufficient or inadequate for feeding two mouths. It is also not in dispute that the net terminal benefits in a sum of Rs. 3.09 lakh paid to the respondent/his mother would have been the same amount which the deceased would have received as terminal benefits after superannuation, had he been alive. Thus, it is not a case where the death of the respondent's father brought about such dire consequence and/or disastrous outcome that the respondent and his mother would have to cope with miserable effects which, as the respondent urged, could be remedied only by offering an appointment on compassionate ground. We regret our inability to be ad idem with learned counsel for the respondent.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 33.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The next sub-issue, which cannot be overlooked, is this. The scheme of 1993 envisages assessment of the suitability of the claimant for compassionate appointment. As has been laid down in several decisions of this Court, noted above, the clauses forming part of the policy/scheme for compassionate appointment have to be followed to the letter. Without the respondent having been subjected to a suitability test, the Division Bench plainly fell in error in directing the respondent's appointment in the category of clerk relying on the decision in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra). It is of some significance that even <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra) did not order appointment but required reconsideration of the claim.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 34.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Whether relaxation in age ought to have been granted is the next subissue. A contention raised on behalf of the respondent, and which succeeded, was to the effect that since he was overaged only by eight months on the date of death of his father, he should have been granted relaxation of age for which power was conferred by the scheme of 1993. We are conscious that there is substance in the contention on behalf of the respondent that this issue is no longer open to be decided here. The decision initially taken that the respondent was over-aged had been set aside in the first round of litigation and, therefore, the principle of res judicata is indeed attracted.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 35.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> However, the point having been argued at some length, our views on interpretation of the scheme of 1993 could be of some worth for courts deciding similar such issue in future. We are in agreement with learned counsel for the appellant that the question of relaxation would arise only when the claimant satisfies the other requirements of the scheme of 1993 for compassionate appointment. What seems to be logical is that no dependant, who otherwise satisfies all criteria for compassionate appointment including suitability, should be told off at the gate solely on the ground of age-bar. If the age of the claimant is found to be within the relaxable limit, discretion is available to be exercised in an appropriate case. Relaxation of age is a step to be taken in the final stages of the entire process and it would arise for consideration provided all other conditions for appointment are satisfied. If in a given case, such as this, that the family of the deceased is not found to be indigent, the first threshold is not crossed and thereby, the process does not progress any further. In such a case, it would be in idle formality to consider whether relaxation of age should be granted.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 36.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Finally, it is noteworthy that although the Single Bench directed further consideration of the claim of the respondent upon quashing of the impugned order of rejection passed by the MD &amp; CEO, the Division Bench went a step further and directed appointment. Power of an appellate court is circumscribed by laws. Unless a particular case in appeal is so exceptional in nature that the appellate court considers it imperative to exercise power akin to power conferred on appellate courts by Order XLI Rule 33, Civil Procedure Code, such power should normally not be exercised.

Briefly put, the question was whether the family members of the employee dying-inharness during the subsistence of the scheme of 1993 were entitled to claim compassionate appointment notwithstanding that their financial condition was good and that the scheme of 1993 had been replaced with the scheme of 2005.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 42.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> While reasoning that the stand of the appellant was unjustified, the coordinate bench had the occasion to consider several decisions of this Court and ultimately held as follows:</P><DIR><p style="Text-align : justify">  <p style="Text-align : justify">&quot;19. Insofar as the contention of the appellant Bank that since the respondent's family is getting family pension and also obtained the terminal benefits, in our view, is of no consequence in considering the application for compassionate appointment. Clause 3.2 of the 1993 Scheme says that in case the dependant of the deceased employee to be offered appointment is a minor, the Bank may keep the offer of appointment open till the minor attains the age of majority. This would indicate that granting of terminal benefits is of no consequence because even if terminal benefit is given, if the applicant is a minor, the Bank would keep the appointment open till the minor attains majority.</P> <p style="Text-align : justify">22. Considering the scope of the scheme 'Dying in Harness Scheme 1993' then in force and the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court rightly directed the appellant Bank to reconsider the claim of the respondent for compassionate appointment in accordance with law and as per the Scheme (1993) then in existence. We do not find any reason warranting interference.&quot;</P></DIR>
   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 43.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In our considered view, the objectives of the scheme of 1993 and the requirements of disclosure relating to financial condition and the details of liabilities of the deceased employee in the prescribed formats (Annexures I and II, respectively) would leave none in doubt about the intention of the policy makers. Overcoming the immediate financial difficulties on account of sudden stoppage of the main source of income and existence of indigent circumstances necessitating employment to one of the dependants being at the heart of the scheme of 1993, it is difficult, if not impossible, to accept it as a valid proposition of law that grant of terminal benefits cannot be of any consequence since paragraph 3.2 of the scheme of 1993 permits the offer of appointment to be kept open till such time the surviving minor dependant, who is to be offered appointment, attains majority. To our mind, what paragraph 3.2 postulates is that, despite there being indigent circumstances necessitating appointment, the object of compassionate appointment thereunder should not be frustrated for mere absence of an eligible dependant family member. The offer would be kept open for such minor to attain majority, whereafter he would be offered appointment subject to suitability, and once he accepts the appointment, he would be under an obligation to look after the other indigent family members. Although paragraph 3.2 may not be wholly in sync with the objective of overcoming immediate financial difficulties, it has to be seen as a benevolent clause extending the benefit of compassionate appointment even beyond reasonable limits, obviously to cover exceptional cases, for ensuring the right of the family members of the deceased employee to live with human dignity. The idea for incorporation of this clause in the scheme of 1993 cannot be confused with grant/release of terminal benefits. Both operate in different arena and, therefore, we respectfully disagree with the reasoning in paragraph 19 of <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra).</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 44.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> As pertinently held in <B>B. Kishore</B> (supra), indigence of the dependants of the deceased employee is the fundamental condition to be satisfied under any scheme for appointment on compassionate ground and that if such indigence is not proved, grant of relief in furtherance of protective discrimination would result in a sort of reservation for the dependents of the employee dying-in-harness, thereby directly conflicting with the ideal of equality guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Also, judicial decisions abound that in deciding a claim for appointment on compassionate grounds, the financial situation of the deceased employee's family must be assessed. In a situation otherwise, the purpose of the scheme may be undermined; without this evaluation, any dependent of an employee who dies while in service might claim a right to employment as if it is heritable.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 45.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> The ratio decidendi of all these decisions have to be read in harmony to achieve the noble goal of giving succour to the dependants of the employee dying-in-harness, who are genuinely in need, and not with the aim of giving them a post for another post.

A reference to a larger bench, as made by the coordinate bench in <B>Sheo Shankar Tewari</B> (supra), if made by us would only add to the agony and pain of the respondent considering that one cannot foresee an imminent resolution of the controversy, in light of the admitted fact that the reference made by <B>Sheo Shankar Tewari</B> (supra) in 2019 is still unanswered.</P> <B> <p style="Text-align : justify"> Conclusion</P> </B>  </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 48.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> Having regard to the foregoing discussion of the predicament faced by the High Court, we cannot hold the impugned order to be entirely unjustified.

The Division Bench, feeling bound by <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra), did not have the occasion to enter into a proper examination of the order of the MD &amp; CEO. It was of the clear impression that the said order was in the teeth of what was held in paragraph 19 by this Court in <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra). However, at the same time, we are of the firm opinion that notwithstanding <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra), the Division Bench ought not to have overlooked the criterion relating to suitability while directing appointment of the respondent straightaway. To this extent, learned counsel for the appellant is right that the question of suitability was left untouched by <B>Canara Bank</B> (supra) and the appellant ought not to have been made to suffer an order on its appeal having more adverse consequences than the order on the writ petition.</P>   </td></tr><tr><td  valign="top"> <p> 49.</td><td valign="top"><p style="Text-align : justify"> In the fitness of things, we have decided to invoke our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.

Though no agreement was reached and whether the respondent is covered under the scheme of 2005 for lumpsum ex-gratia payment has not been examined by us as well as by the High Court, but bearing in mind the approach of the coordinate bench coupled with the circumstance of hope being generated in the mind of the respondent for appointment based on his success before the High Court, we are satisfied that interest of justice would be sufficiently served if the appellant is directed to make a lumpsum payment of Rs.2.5 lakh to the respondent within a period of 2 (two) months from date and the proceedings be closed.
